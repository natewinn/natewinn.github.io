  <h1 class="post-title">How to Win the Internet</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>
  <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington">John Saddington</a>, partner at The Iron Yard, stopped by to chat with the Ruby and iOS cohorts about <em>Winning the Internet</em>. His challenge to us was simple. <strong>Be in control of our brand online</strong>. Each of us have the power to curate what people find when Googling our name. </p>

<h2>Still Learning</h2>

<p>Because competition has become so fierce in the marketplace, you must show others why you are different, what sets you a part from the pack. The goal is not to show others that you are an expert, but to show others <em>your constant pursuit in becoming an expert</em>. This is precisely the reason I entitled this blog, &quot;Still Learning.&quot; The more I learn, the more I realize how much more I have to learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are people that do and there are people that dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To <em>Win the Internet</em>, John challenged us with four practical thoughts about how we can make ourselves stand out in a crowd.</p>

<h2>Capture a thought and tell others.</h2>

<p>Take one specific thing and show people that you understand it. Then, take that <strong>a step further</strong>. Prove you are able to take what you&#39;ve learned and help others understand it. It is easy to comprehend a topic for yourself, but to be able to transfer that knowledge in a <em>clear, relatable message</em> to someone else is invaluable.</p>

<h2>Donâ€™t be afraid to be unique.</h2>

<p>Being unique is what sets you apart from the pack. Having an opinion and telling others how you really feel is important! Apple has become an industry leader with <a href="http://www.thecrazyones.it/spot-en.html">Think Different</a>. Their entire company culture is built around challenging the status quo. Companies are looking for people who *care, and having an opinion proves you are passionate about whatever you undertake.</p>

<h2>Talk about how your are improving.</h2>

<p>Show others that you are a <em>lifelong learner</em>. When put in the proper perspective, every experience has the opportunity to be a teachable moment. This shows others that you are not interested in just existing, but consistently striving to improve yourself and others around you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone that you meet knows something you don&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one likes working with a know it all! And by telling others what you are attempting to learn, you prove to others you <em>have not arrived</em>.</p>

<h2>Prove you can be an ambassador</h2>

<p>Effective communication is arguably the most valued asset to a company. By having a message online, you are effectively an ambassador for yourself. By communicating the value of your own personal brand, you are proving <em>ahead of time</em> that you can transfer that to whatever company you work for.</p>

<p>I was challenged to tailor the images and content that returned when people search for me online. I want people to be wowed when googling &quot;Nate Winn.&quot; How are you winning the internet?</p>
