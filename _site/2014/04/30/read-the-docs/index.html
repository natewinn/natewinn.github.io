  <h1 class="post-title">Read the Docs</h1>
  <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2014</span>
  <p>I&#39;m <em>constantly</em> having problems with my code or don&#39;t fully understand a concept being covered in class. After wrestling over it for an embarrassing amount of time, I will ask my instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">Shelby</a>, for help. Her standard response is <em>always</em>, &quot;Did you read the docs?&quot; In other words, did you try reading the &quot;instruction manual&quot; before trying to &quot;assemble&quot; your code. She&#39;s not doing this to be mean, but to teach me to be a <strong>problem solver</strong>, to step back and understand what is happening at a foundational level instead of just rigging together some code. </p>

<p>After looking at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>, I noticed the option to download the guides for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWH595M/ref=fs_clw">Kindle</a>. After looking at a computer screen (literally) all day, the last thing I want to do is read documentation on my computer. So, I sprung for a Kindle during a recent sale. Since loading up Ruby Guides, both the Guides and the Kindle have become an <em>awesome</em> tool.</p>

<h2>Readable Documentation</h2>

<p>The Rails Guides are pretty sweet (Yes, you were right, Shelby!). They are written in a very conversational tone and not typical engineer language. Also, the documentation begins by taking you through a real world example of how to practically implement Rails. You will realize <em>very quickly</em> the Guides are more than just a step-by-step list of instructions. Instead, Rails Guides will lead you through errors created by each step. The Guides will explain why the error occurs, why Rails is set up that way, and what you can add to eliminate the error. So, you&#39;re not just learning the <em>how</em>, but the <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>The last time <a href="http://john.do/">John</a> spoke to our cohort about <a href="/2014/04/28/projects-to-products/">Taking Projects to Products</a> he mentioned documentation. When developing <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a> for iOS, John, even as a seasoned software engineer, started reading the iOS docs from the beginning. This was a huge lesson to me. He went on to explain that <em>no one</em> is above the docs. There&#39;s nothing fancy or cool about the docs, but they work.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Rails Guides are an incredible reference tool. But, if you&#39;re just starting out, I would encourage you to not go buffet-style and pick and choose from the Guides. Instead, start from the beginning to gain a firm understanding of how Rails works. Honestly, I have just about zero time to right now, but having the Kindle is allowing me to read more consistently.</p>

<h2>Accessible Documentation</h2>

<p>Since being at The Iron Yard, I&#39;ve purchased a few reference books that have been a help to me. But, to be honest, I have to <em>purpose</em> to get them out and read them. They are big, heavy and not really that convenient to carry around. To take them out in a moments notice and read a few pages doesn&#39;t happen very often, which is why I&#39;m loving the Kindle.</p>

<p>The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B3HLOA4/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">137 Books in One Year</a>, is a motivating read. Kevin Hendricks explains how he read 137 books in just one year. The major takeaway is to <em>always have a book on hand</em> to read at a moments notice. Recapture even the smallest chunks of time to read. This could be while brushing your teeth, cooking something in the microwave, or waiting for your computer to reboot. I take Marta in because it&#39;s super close to <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">ATV</a> so, I do my best to recapture the time waiting for the train and riding on the train by reading.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...I&#39;m literally getting about 5 hours of sleep a night. But, the small amounts of time I do have I try to recapture.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle + Rails Guides = Awesome</strong></p>
