  <p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is a newbie coder&#39;s best friend. But, when approaching a new concept don&#39;t head for that search bar just yet! Your first step <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be to scour the web when you&#39;re setting out to tackle a new challenge. It&#39;s understandable that a new concept can be overwhelming, and the thought of trying to do something new can be daunting. But, instead of turning to the internet, try to breakdown the new challenge into actionable chunks that you <em>can</em> complete. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logically think through what you have to accomplish and figure out the essential steps needed to accomplish those tasks. This happened <strong>today</strong> when we had to create a jQuery modal by ourselves. It was a daunting task when you see the code for most modals you find online. You see the code and think it <em>has</em> to be complicated and there&#39;s <em>no way</em> I can do that. And I fell right into the trap. When we came into class this morning, Shelby asked us to break it down. In reality, a modal can be accomplished as easy as using a javascript .on(&#39;click&#39;) on a .div set to display:none.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself first . . . even if you <em>know</em> you&#39;re going to fail. Once, you create your own iteration <a href="/2014/05/01/the-rubber-duck/">talk through it</a>. See if you can spot any errors errors. If not, then you can start searching. Before getting carried away and letting hours upon hours of time pass, here are <strong>six tips</strong> to finding a solution on Google.</p>

<h2>Guides First</h2>

<p>Turn to the docs/guides before you go anywhere else online. I&#39;ve mentioned before just how <a href="/2014/04/30/read-the-docs/">valuable</a> the docs can be. In all honesty, the docs are generally going to be the first thing that comes up with a Google search anyway. So, you might as well start there. You&#39;ll find <em>many</em> problems can be solved and <em>much</em> time can be saved by just looking at the docs. </p>

<h2>Be Specific</h2>

<p>If you strike out with the docs then jump on Google. Remember, generic searches won&#39;t shed any light on your problem. Take a second to accurately frame your search by <em>describing the problem</em> and <em>thinking of key search terms</em>; or else you&#39;ll quickly find yourself endlessly wading through irrelevant information. For example, I was trying to get a conirmation email to be sent to the user following new account creation using the Devise gem. Instead of searching &quot;Devise mail,&quot; I searched &quot;Rails Devise Mailer New Account Confirmation.&quot; As you gain experience and become more familiar with syntax, the specificity of your searches will improve. </p>

<h2>Tinker with It</h2>

<p>It&#39;s <em>unlikely</em> you&#39;re ever going to find an &quot;out of the box&quot; solution for <em>your</em> problem. So, you&#39;re probably going to have to finesse a similar solution you find online. This could be as simple as changing variables or as complicated as refactoring an entire method. Here are <strong>three tips</strong> to keep in mind when you start to tinker with a <em>possible</em> solution you come across . . .</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep track of what you&#39;ve tried so you’re not repeating the same thing over and over again.</li>
<li> Don’t be afraid to try new stuff! That&#39;s what&#39;s so awesome about coding . . . you can just use backspace if it doesn&#39;t work!</li>
<li>Keep your &quot;master branch&quot; isolated. Create a new branch or just have an &quot;experiment&quot; file open in your text editor to try out new stuff.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try Again</h2>

<p>If a solution you have found doesn&#39;t work, take a look again and target similar Stack Overflow posts. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is an awesome resource, but it can be a bit of a black hole if you&#39;re not careful. It&#39;s very easy to waste tons of time trying to track down a solution. Keep in mind, the solutions on Stack Overflow are for very specific questions begin asked. This could be a <em>good</em> or a <em>bad</em> thing! Oftentimes, you&#39;ll have to heavily refactor an answer. Regardless if the solution you find is similar or not, don&#39;t copy and paste it directly into your code. First, it&#39;s almost never going to work, and secondly, you&#39;re not going to learn <em>why</em> it works. Lastly, for the post to help, you <em>must</em> read both the question and answer in its <strong>entirety</strong>. It&#39;s going to be tempting to scroll down to that green checkmark, but DON&#39;T DO IT! </p>

<h2>Trash It</h2>

<p>The neat thing about coding is there are so many different ways to do the same thing. If your approach just isn&#39;t working, trash it, and start over! Don&#39;t be so attached to your code that you can&#39;t throw it away and start over. By starting with a clean slate, you&#39;ll more than likely create a better solution for tackling your problem than with your first attempt. </p>

<h2>Find an Expert</h2>

<p>If you <em>must</em> do it the way you&#39;re doing it, seek out an expert to help you solve your problem. Get a mentor or maybe post a question on Stack Overflow. Just <em>don&#39;t</em> spend a crazy amount of time on the same problem. When you do get some expert assistance, don&#39;t copy and paste. Again, look through what you&#39;ve tried previously and <em>see where you went wrong</em>. Remember, coding is not a single destination; it&#39;s a journey!</p>
