  <p>My son, Owen, will be 9 months old tomorrow. It&#39;s <em>incredible</em> how fast the time has gone by! On days like this, I like to look through the pictures my wife and I have taken of him and take just a few moments to reminisce.</p>

<p>Without fail, I say to my wife, “I can’t believe how much he has grown!” In fact, I <em>always</em> remind her of the picture I took when she put him in his carseat for the the very first time. His newborn clothes were so big on him, and he nearly disappeared into his carseat.</p>

<h2>Overlooking Progress</h2>

<p>It’s so apparent by looking back to his first few days of life to see how much he has grown. He now sleeps through the night, crawls, interacts with us, and climbs on things (Yes, he climbed up there all by himself in that picture below!). My son’s growth or “progress” is so easy to overlook on a daily basis. My progress at The Iron Yard is no different.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Owen perched on his favorite spot</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The daily grind is incredibly taxing, and it seems that our cohort is making slow progress. But, when you take a step back and look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926">first gist</a> we posted on GitHub, you can begin to see it. Real progress! Don’t get me wrong, in the world of RubyOnRails I’m still an infant crawling around on the floor. But I’m definitely not a newborn any longer.</p>

<p>Six weeks ago today, I boarded an airplane to leave my family, knowing next to nothing about code. Yesterday, I pushed a web app to a <a href="https://github.com/natewinn/remember">GitHub Repo</a> where users can upload photos and add tags or comments. And, no, I didn’t have an idea what a “GitHub Repo” was 6 weeks ago. Looking back, today, at “half-time,” it&#39;s pretty cool to see how far we have come.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>When setting out to achieve a goal, no matter how big or small, take a step back on milestone days and recall the progress you&#39;ve made—<em>not to pat yourself on the back</em> for the steps that you’ve made, but to <em>motivate you to accomplish even more</em> in the days ahead.</p>
