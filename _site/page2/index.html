    <p>Screen sharing for computers isn’t something revolutionary. It&#39;s been around for years. Mac users will remember the days of iChat with AIM to enable video chat and screen sharing. But, you were limited to sharing with just fellow mac users — not to mention it was pretty temperamental, especially if you didn&#39;t have the right ports open on your router. Skype solved the cross-platform problem, but until recently you needed a premium account to access screen sharing. Even though screen sharing is available for all accounts, I find Skype&#39;s quality lacking and interface unnecessarily complicated. <em>But, fear not</em>! There’s a new tool that saves the day. </p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-17-screenhero-logo.png" alt="Screenhero Logo"></img></p>

<h2>It’s a bird, it’s a plane . . .</h2>

<p>For incredibly simple, yet incredibly awesome screen sharing look no further than <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a>. Don&#39;t let the beta tag on the website scare you away. Though still in beta, Screenhero is <em>way</em> better than any screen sharing solution available. The folks over at Screenhero have labeled their product &quot;Google Docs for any application on your computer.&quot; <strong>And it&#39;s true</strong>! You can seamlessly collaborate with colleagues using any software on your computer. Getting started is as easy as downloading, installing, adding a contact, and clicking &quot;share&quot; in your menubar. </p>

<p>Screenhero has all the basics covered - bundled voice chat, cross platform support, great video and audio quality, and a minimalistic design. But, they have taken it a step further with <em>some amazing features</em>.</p>

<h2>Multiple mouse cursers</h2>

<p>Each user can <em>independently</em> control his own mouse curser on the screen. You can clearly see which curser belongs to each user with a convenient name label.</p>

<h2>Remote copy and paste</h2>

<p>Wanting to copy and paste while on sharing someone else&#39;s desktop? <strong>No problem</strong>! Using copy and paste will copy to your local clipboard. <em>It&#39;s like magic</em>! The awesome part is using copy function will not affect the clipboard of the person&#39;s screen you are on. </p>

<h2>Switch screens</h2>

<p>With just the click of a button, you can switch your screen and the screen of the user you are connected with. True collaboration! It&#39;s even more convenient than sitting next to the person you are working with because you can work on each other’s computer <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<h2>Voice chat</h2>

<p>No need to share your screen to chat. Quickly voice chat without revealing your screen. Boasting crisp, 48kHz audio with echo cancellation, Screenhero is an easy way to connect with anyone on your contact list.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t quite realize how awesome Screenhero was until completing a group assignment just a few weeks ago. My partner and I completed much of a Sinatra app while working together remotely with Screenhero. We were both able to code the app on a single screen. <strong>Crazy right</strong>? We also switched back and forth between our desktops as we completed different parts of the app. </p>

<h2>But wait there&#39;s more!</h2>

<p>The possibilities are endless! And it&#39;s not just a great tool for collaboration, but for troubleshooting as well. It&#39;s the perfect app to help a family member with a nagging computer problem. No need to wait for Thanksgiving dinner to help Uncle Ed get his computer squared away. </p>

<p>Screenhero has become an <em>invaluable tool</em> among our cohort at The Iron Yard - to get emergency assistant from our instructor, Shelby, collaborate on group assignments, or lend each other a hand.</p>

<p>All this for the low, low price of . . . <strong>free</strong>. Go get it <a href="http://screenhero.com/download.html">now</a>.</p>

    <p>Though I&#39;m 30-years-old and just now diving into coding, I realize there is no better time to learn than <strong>now</strong>. It&#39;s never <em>too late</em> to start learning. The landscape is changing so fast that <em>everyone</em> has to be continually learning the latest technologies. So, there&#39;s always a good spot to jump in. Don&#39;t let a late start discourage you from getting started! There&#39;s no better day than <strong>today</strong> to start learning.</p>

<p>Starbucks is my usual Sunday morning spot. I get there early to work on my weekend homework. This past Sunday, the New York Times caught my eye on the way in. This was on the front page:</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-16-the-language-of-the-future.jpg" alt="NYT Article - Reading, Writing, and Now Coding"></img><figure><figcaption>Parents and Educators are Realizing the Importance of Coding</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It&#39;s cool to see kids getting excited about code and problem solving at such a young age. Many parents and educators are realizing that programming is the language of the future and kids better start learning <strong>now</strong>. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/us/reading-writing-arithmetic-and-lately-coding.html?_r=0">NYT article</a> goes on tell just how popular coding programs for kids are becoming. Kids are ditching video games for programs like <a href="http://turtleacademy.com/">Turtle Academy</a> and <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. &quot;Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive.&quot;</p>

<h2>The Next Generation</h2>

<p>Though still just a beginner, I&#39;m looking forward to teaching at <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/scratch/">The Iron Yard Kids Academy</a> on May 29. It&#39;s going to be fun to spark an interest in future programmers. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a place to get started with code, for both kids and adults, you&#39;ll find an awesome list of resources <a href="https://medium.com/global-silicon-valley/a2dc04ea9529">here</a>. Jump in and get started today!</p>

    <p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is a newbie coder&#39;s best friend. But, when approaching a new concept don&#39;t head for that search bar just yet! Your first step <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be to scour the web when you&#39;re setting out to tackle a new challenge. It&#39;s understandable that a new concept can be overwhelming, and the thought of trying to do something new can be daunting. But, instead of turning to the internet, try to breakdown the new challenge into actionable chunks that you <em>can</em> complete. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logically think through what you have to accomplish and figure out the essential steps needed to accomplish those tasks. This happened <strong>today</strong> when we had to create a jQuery modal by ourselves. It was a daunting task when you see the code for most modals you find online. You see the code and think it <em>has</em> to be complicated and there&#39;s <em>no way</em> I can do that. And I fell right into the trap. When we came into class this morning, Shelby asked us to break it down. In reality, a modal can be accomplished as easy as using a javascript .on(&#39;click&#39;) on a .div set to display:none.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself first . . . even if you <em>know</em> you&#39;re going to fail. Once, you create your own iteration <a href="/the-rubber-duck.html">talk through it</a>. See if you can spot any errors errors. If not, then you can start searching. Before getting carried away and letting hours upon hours of time pass, here are <strong>six tips</strong> to finding a solution on Google.</p>

<h2>Guides First</h2>

<p>Turn to the docs/guides before you go anywhere else online. I&#39;ve mentioned before just how <a href="/read-the-docs.html">valuable</a> the docs can be. In all honesty, the docs are generally going to be the first thing that comes up with a Google search anyway. So, you might as well start there. You&#39;ll find <em>many</em> problems can be solved and <em>much</em> time can be saved by just looking at the docs. </p>

<h2>Be Specific</h2>

<p>If you strike out with the docs then jump on Google. Remember, generic searches won&#39;t shed any light on your problem. Take a second to accurately frame your search by <em>describing the problem</em> and <em>thinking of key search terms</em>; or else you&#39;ll quickly find yourself endlessly wading through irrelevant information. For example, I was trying to get a conirmation email to be sent to the user following new account creation using the Devise gem. Instead of searching &quot;Devise mail,&quot; I searched &quot;Rails Devise Mailer New Account Confirmation.&quot; As you gain experience and become more familiar with syntax, the specificity of your searches will improve. </p>

<h2>Tinker with It</h2>

<p>It&#39;s <em>unlikely</em> you&#39;re ever going to find an &quot;out of the box&quot; solution for <em>your</em> problem. So, you&#39;re probably going to have to finesse a similar solution you find online. This could be as simple as changing variables or as complicated as refactoring an entire method. Here are <strong>three tips</strong> to keep in mind when you start to tinker with a <em>possible</em> solution you come across . . .</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep track of what you&#39;ve tried so you’re not repeating the same thing over and over again.</li>
<li> Don’t be afraid to try new stuff! That&#39;s what&#39;s so awesome about coding . . . you can just use backspace if it doesn&#39;t work!</li>
<li>Keep your &quot;master branch&quot; isolated. Create a new branch or just have an &quot;experiment&quot; file open in your text editor to try out new stuff.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try Again</h2>

<p>If a solution you have found doesn&#39;t work, take a look again and target similar Stack Overflow posts. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is an awesome resource, but it can be a bit of a black hole if you&#39;re not careful. It&#39;s very easy to waste tons of time trying to track down a solution. Keep in mind, the solutions on Stack Overflow are for very specific questions begin asked. This could be a <em>good</em> or a <em>bad</em> thing! Oftentimes, you&#39;ll have to heavily refactor an answer. Regardless if the solution you find is similar or not, don&#39;t copy and paste it directly into your code. First, it&#39;s almost never going to work, and secondly, you&#39;re not going to learn <em>why</em> it works. Lastly, for the post to help, you <em>must</em> read both the question and answer in its <strong>entirety</strong>. It&#39;s going to be tempting to scroll down to that green checkmark, but DON&#39;T DO IT! </p>

<h2>Trash It</h2>

<p>The neat thing about coding is there are so many different ways to do the same thing. If your approach just isn&#39;t working, trash it, and start over! Don&#39;t be so attached to your code that you can&#39;t throw it away and start over. By starting with a clean slate, you&#39;ll more than likely create a better solution for tackling your problem than with your first attempt. </p>

<h2>Find an Expert</h2>

<p>If you <em>must</em> do it the way you&#39;re doing it, seek out an expert to help you solve your problem. Get a mentor or maybe post a question on Stack Overflow. Just <em>don&#39;t</em> spend a crazy amount of time on the same problem. When you do get some expert assistance, don&#39;t copy and paste. Again, look through what you&#39;ve tried previously and <em>see where you went wrong</em>. Remember, coding is not a single destination; it&#39;s a journey!</p>

        Throwing In the Towel

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2014</span>

    <p>It&#39;s midnight, and I&#39;m <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_in_the_towel">throwing in the towel</a>. Every day at The Iron Yard is difficult, but today was just one of those days. I walked in to ATV around 6:30am. Since then, I have been outside only three times-a Starbucks run, to FaceTime my family, and to grab something to eat. Based on the homework assigned for tonight, I thought my day would be a relatively easy day. <strong>Nope</strong>. Things didn&#39;t go as expected pretty early on, and my &quot;easy&quot; day was anything but. Since I started to code, I have realized that everything isn&#39;t going to immediately make sense or work the first time I try. As a matter of fact, <em>very few things do</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Day</h2>

<p>When a boxer&#39;s manager &quot;throws in the towel&quot; on his behalf, he&#39;s not quitting on the sport. Just that particular match. There will be another opponent to face. Tomorrow will be a new day for me, another day to crack open the lid to my MacBook and <em>try even harder</em>. I&#39;ve come to realize The Iron Yard isn&#39;t just about completing a single task, though collectively those assignments are extremely important. Instead, it is a <em>continual pursuit towards bettering myself as a coder</em>. And just one assignment isn&#39;t going to accomplish that. I&#39;m not saying that to minimize the daily homework I have, but it&#39;s a good reminder that there will inevitably be days when things <em>just aren&#39;t going to fall into place</em>. There will be setbacks no matter if you are coding or crocheting. Just remember that <strong>tomorrow</strong> will be another opportunity to strive toward reaching your goal.</p>
