        Halftime
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 May 2014</span>

    <p>My son, Owen, will be 9 months old tomorrow. It&#39;s <em>incredible</em> how fast the time has gone by! On days like this, I like to look through the pictures my wife and I have taken of him and take just a few moments to reminisce.</p>

<p>Without fail, I say to my wife, “I can’t believe how much he has grown!” In fact, I <em>always</em> remind her of the picture I took when she put him in his carseat for the the very first time. His newborn clothes were so big on him, and he nearly disappeared into his carseat.</p>

<h2>Overlooking Progress</h2>

<p>It’s so apparent by looking back to his first few days of life to see how much he has grown. He now sleeps through the night, crawls, interacts with us, and climbs on things (Yes, he climbed up there all by himself in that picture below!). My son’s growth or “progress” is so easy to overlook on a daily basis. My progress at The Iron Yard is no different.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-10-owen-on-nightstand.jpg" alt="Owen on the Nightstand"></img>
<figure><figcaption>Owen perched on his favorite spot</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The daily grind is incredibly taxing, and it seems that our cohort is making slow progress. But, when you take a step back and look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926">first gist</a> we posted on GitHub, you can begin to see it. Real progress! Don’t get me wrong, in the world of RubyOnRails I’m still an infant crawling around on the floor. But I’m definitely not a newborn any longer.</p>

<p>Six weeks ago today, I boarded an airplane to leave my family, knowing next to nothing about code. Yesterday, I pushed a web app to a <a href="https://github.com/natewinn/remember">GitHub Repo</a> where users can upload photos and add tags or comments. And, no, I didn’t have an idea what a “GitHub Repo” was 6 weeks ago. Looking back, today, at “half-time,” it&#39;s pretty cool to see how far we have come.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>When setting out to achieve a goal, no matter how big or small, take a step back on milestone days and recall the progress you&#39;ve made—<em>not to pat yourself on the back</em> for the steps that you’ve made, but to <em>motivate you to accomplish even more</em> in the days ahead.</p>

        A Common Goal

    <span class="post-date">03 May 2014</span>

    <p>Having someone with which to strive toward a common goal will exponentially increase your chances of success. This is exactly why the <a href="http://john.do/dream-big-dreams/">cohort model</a> at The Iron Yard is so awesome. When sailing out into unchartered territory and attempting to achieve something big, it is <em>vital</em> to have someone you can be accountable to—someone who is able to celebrate each success, yet encourage with every setback. </p>

<h2>An Equal Challenge</h2>

<p>When my wife and I finally decided I would attend The Iron Yard, she also wanted to challenge herself. She knew I was facing the most difficult challenges of my life so; she also wanted conquer something equally as challenging—run a marathon. As we have both had our ups and downs in striving to reach our goals, we are able to <em>keep each other motivated</em> to stay on track to reach our respective goals.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Before the Big Race</figcaption></figure></p>

<h2>Motivated By Others</h2>

<p>This weekend, I was able to fly across the country for just a day and a half to see my wife complete the <a href="http://www.brazenracing.com/westernpacific.html">Western Pacific Marathon</a>. It was incredibly motivating to see her cross that finish line. I keep a picture of her wearing the finisher&#39;s medal on my desktop and often look at it during the day. It motivates me to press forward becuase I so often get discouraged.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-03-after-run.jpg" alt="Winn Family After the Race"></img>
<figure><figcaption>After Crossing the Finish Line</figcaption></figure> </p>

<p>There have been <em>numerous</em> times along the way that I&#39;ve really wanted to throw in the towel. It says <strong>intensive</strong> on The Iron Yard website for good reason! But, I try to remember the <a href="/2014/04/15/teamwork-makes-the-dream-work/">people</a> pulling for me, and I don&#39;t want to let them down. I would encourage you in setting out to achieve something big, take someone along for the ride.</p>

        The Rubber Duck
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>

    <p>Today, <a href="http://timw.co/">Tim Whitacre</a> of <a href="http://argyllstudios.com/">Argyll Studios</a> joined us at The Iron Yard to discuss his experiences as a front-end developer. During his talk, he mentioned <em>duck programming</em>, a reference to a story in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. </p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-01-rubber-duck.jpg" alt="Rubber Duck"></img></p>

<h2>Line-by-line</h2>

<p>Duck programming is debugging by explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck. In other words, describing what the code is <em>supposed to do</em> and then <em>observing what it actually does</em>. Tim said that duck programming has enabled him to solve countless problems he has encountered over the years. When stumped, he challenged us to answer the following questions about our code: </p>

<ol>
<li>What is your code actually doing?</li>
<li>What do you expect your code to do?</li>
<li>What resources have you looked into to fix the problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>His advice has already proven to be a help to me. When I&#39;m unable to get past a problem in my code, I step back, go for a walk around the block, and <em>try</em> to go through my code systematically. It doesn&#39;t always work, but there have been times I&#39;ve fixed minor problems realatively quickly.</p>

        Read the Docs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;m <em>constantly</em> having problems with my code or don&#39;t fully understand a concept being covered in class. After wrestling over it for an embarrassing amount of time, I will ask my instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">Shelby</a>, for help. Her standard response is <em>always</em>, &quot;Did you read the docs?&quot; In other words, did you try reading the &quot;instruction manual&quot; before trying to &quot;assemble&quot; your code. She&#39;s not doing this to be mean, but to teach me to be a <strong>problem solver</strong>, to step back and understand what is happening at a foundational level instead of just rigging together some code. </p>

<p>After looking at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>, I noticed the option to download the guides for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWH595M/ref=fs_clw">Kindle</a>. After looking at a computer screen (literally) all day, the last thing I want to do is read documentation on my computer. So, I sprung for a Kindle during a recent sale. Since loading up Ruby Guides, both the Guides and the Kindle have become an <em>awesome</em> tool.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-04-30-kindle-on-the-plane.png" alt="Ruby Guides on Kindle"></img>
<figure><figcaption>Reading the Ruby Guides on my Flight Home</figcaption></figure></p>

<h2>Readable Documentation</h2>

<p>The Rails Guides are pretty sweet (Yes, you were right, Shelby!). They are written in a very conversational tone and not typical engineer language. Also, the documentation begins by taking you through a real world example of how to practically implement Rails. You will realize <em>very quickly</em> the Guides are more than just a step-by-step list of instructions. Instead, Rails Guides will lead you through errors created by each step. The Guides will explain why the error occurs, why Rails is set up that way, and what you can add to eliminate the error. So, you&#39;re not just learning the <em>how</em>, but the <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>The last time <a href="http://john.do/">John</a> spoke to our cohort about <a href="/2014/04/28/projects-to-products/">Taking Projects to Products</a> he mentioned documentation. When developing <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a> for iOS, John, even as a seasoned software engineer, started reading the iOS docs from the beginning. This was a huge lesson to me. He went on to explain that <em>no one</em> is above the docs. There&#39;s nothing fancy or cool about the docs, but they work.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Rails Guides are an incredible reference tool. But, if you&#39;re just starting out, I would encourage you to not go buffet-style and pick and choose from the Guides. Instead, start from the beginning to gain a firm understanding of how Rails works. Honestly, I have just about zero time to right now, but having the Kindle is allowing me to read more consistently.</p>

<h2>Accessible Documentation</h2>

<p>Since being at The Iron Yard, I&#39;ve purchased a few reference books that have been a help to me. But, to be honest, I have to <em>purpose</em> to get them out and read them. They are big, heavy and not really that convenient to carry around. To take them out in a moments notice and read a few pages doesn&#39;t happen very often, which is why I&#39;m loving the Kindle.</p>

<p>The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B3HLOA4/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">137 Books in One Year</a>, is a motivating read. Kevin Hendricks explains how he read 137 books in just one year. The major takeaway is to <em>always have a book on hand</em> to read at a moments notice. Recapture even the smallest chunks of time to read. This could be while brushing your teeth, cooking something in the microwave, or waiting for your computer to reboot. I take Marta in because it&#39;s super close to <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">ATV</a> so, I do my best to recapture the time waiting for the train and riding on the train by reading.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...I&#39;m literally getting about 5 hours of sleep a night. But, the small amounts of time I do have I try to recapture.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle + Rails Guides = Awesome</strong></p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>John spoke to us today about his latest creation <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a>, an iOS app that allows you to edit, filter, and publish photos to your own blog and site. It was a practical look into turning a <em>project</em> into a sellable <em>product</em>. The talk was <strong>epic</strong> with tons of practical advice from a proven entrepreneur. Here are my top takeaways . . .</p>

<h2>Innovative solutions are mashups of ineffective solutions</h2>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun! Innovators that are winning are able to take current ineffective solutions and mash them up to create a winning product. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complexity is easy to create, but simplicity is art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often times, innovative products are nothing more than <em>simplifications</em>. If you create systems to take complex problems and make them simplistic, you will be on the fast track to creating effective products.</p>

<h2>You don’t need complex tools to build stuff</h2>

<p>John demonstrated how he created his first mockups of Pressgram. He used <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote</a>. Yes, that keynote. His goal was not to create a fancy mockup using the latest tools available, but to create a minimum viable product that could be <em>easily and effectively</em> communicated to others. Regardless, if the app is meant to function as a slide deck, John used a simple tool he was familiar with to get the job done. The goal is not to be enamored with the latest and greatest tools, but to focus on honing your product with the tools you have.</p>

<h2>Create emotional attachment by personalizing it</h2>

<p>At this point in our cohort, we&#39;re creating simplistic apps. But, we were challenged to constantly be thinking about how we can make our assigned projects, <em>our products</em>. The key in creating a winning product is having an emotional attachment to it, creating something that you <em>really</em> want. This is exactly what a start-up at Atlanta Tech Village did. Co-founders <a href="https://vergilis.co/stanley/">Stanley Vergilis</a> wanted a way to book tutoring students and <a href="https://vergilis.co/james/">James Loper</a> a better way to fix iPhone screens than his Craigslist post. So, they created <a href="https://vergilis.co/">Vergilis</a>. The key, they created something they <em>wanted</em>. Do this and passion will be inevitable.</p>
