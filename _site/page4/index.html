        The Rubber Duck
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>

    <p>Today, <a href="http://timw.co/">Tim Whitacre</a> of <a href="http://argyllstudios.com/">Argyll Studios</a> joined us at The Iron Yard to discuss his experiences as a front-end developer. During his talk, he mentioned <em>duck programming</em>, a reference to a story in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. </p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-01-rubber-duck.jpg" alt="Rubber Duck"></img></p>

<h2>Line-by-line</h2>

<p>Duck programming is debugging by explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck. In other words, describing what the code is <em>supposed to do</em> and then <em>observing what it actually does</em>. Tim said that duck programming has enabled him to solve countless problems he has encountered over the years. When stumped, he challenged us to answer the following questions about our code: </p>

<ol>
<li>What is your code actually doing?</li>
<li>What do you expect your code to do?</li>
<li>What resources have you looked into to fix the problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>His advice has already proven to be a help to me. When I&#39;m unable to get past a problem in my code, I step back, go for a walk around the block, and <em>try</em> to go through my code systematically. It doesn&#39;t always work, but there have been times I&#39;ve fixed minor problems realatively quickly.</p>

        Read the Docs

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;m <em>constantly</em> having problems with my code or don&#39;t fully understand a concept being covered in class. After wrestling over it for an embarrassing amount of time, I will ask my instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">Shelby</a>, for help. Her standard response is <em>always</em>, &quot;Did you read the docs?&quot; In other words, did you try reading the &quot;instruction manual&quot; before trying to &quot;assemble&quot; your code. She&#39;s not doing this to be mean, but to teach me to be a <strong>problem solver</strong>, to step back and understand what is happening at a foundational level instead of just rigging together some code. </p>

<p>After looking at the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Guides</a>, I noticed the option to download the guides for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AWH595M/ref=fs_clw">Kindle</a>. After looking at a computer screen (literally) all day, the last thing I want to do is read documentation on my computer. So, I sprung for a Kindle during a recent sale. Since loading up Ruby Guides, both the Guides and the Kindle have become an <em>awesome</em> tool.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-04-30-kindle-on-the-plane.png" alt="Ruby Guides on Kindle"></img>

<h2>Readable Documentation</h2>

<p>The Rails Guides are pretty sweet (Yes, you were right, Shelby!). They are written in a very conversational tone and not typical engineer language. Also, the documentation begins by taking you through a real world example of how to practically implement Rails. You will realize <em>very quickly</em> the Guides are more than just a step-by-step list of instructions. Instead, Rails Guides will lead you through errors created by each step. The Guides will explain why the error occurs, why Rails is set up that way, and what you can add to eliminate the error. So, you&#39;re not just learning the <em>how</em>, but the <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>The last time <a href="http://john.do/">John</a> spoke to our cohort about <a href="/projects-to-products.html">Taking Projects to Products</a> he mentioned documentation. When developing <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a> for iOS, John, even as a seasoned software engineer, started reading the iOS docs from the beginning. This was a huge lesson to me. He went on to explain that <em>no one</em> is above the docs. There&#39;s nothing fancy or cool about the docs, but they work.</p>

<p>Obviously, the Rails Guides are an incredible reference tool. But, if you&#39;re just starting out, I would encourage you to not go buffet-style and pick and choose from the Guides. Instead, start from the beginning to gain a firm understanding of how Rails works. Honestly, I have just about zero time to right now, but having the Kindle is allowing me to read more consistently.</p>

<h2>Accessible Documentation</h2>

<p>Since being at The Iron Yard, I&#39;ve purchased a few reference books that have been a help to me. But, to be honest, I have to <em>purpose</em> to get them out and read them. They are big, heavy and not really that convenient to carry around. To take them out in a moments notice and read a few pages doesn&#39;t happen very often, which is why I&#39;m loving the Kindle.</p>

<p>The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B3HLOA4/ref=kinw_myk_ro_title">137 Books in One Year</a>, is a motivating read. Kevin Hendricks explains how he read 137 books in just one year. The major takeaway is to <em>always have a book on hand</em> to read at a moments notice. Recapture even the smallest chunks of time to read. This could be while brushing your teeth, cooking something in the microwave, or waiting for your computer to reboot. I take Marta in because it&#39;s super close to <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">ATV</a> so, I do my best to recapture the time waiting for the train and riding on the train by reading.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong...I&#39;m literally getting about 5 hours of sleep a night. But, the small amounts of time I do have I try to recapture.</p>

<p><strong>Kindle + Rails Guides = Awesome</strong></p>

    <p>John spoke to us today about his latest creation <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a>, an iOS app that allows you to edit, filter, and publish photos to your own blog and site. It was a practical look into turning a <em>project</em> into a sellable <em>product</em>. The talk was <strong>epic</strong> with tons of practical advice from a proven entrepreneur. Here are my top takeaways . . .</p>

<h2>Innovative solutions are mashups of ineffective solutions</h2>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun! Innovators that are winning are able to take current ineffective solutions and mash them up to create a winning product. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complexity is easy to create, but simplicity is art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often times, innovative products are nothing more than <em>simplifications</em>. If you create systems to take complex problems and make them simplistic, you will be on the fast track to creating effective products.</p>

<h2>You donâ€™t need complex tools to build stuff</h2>

<p>John demonstrated how he created his first mockups of Pressgram. He used <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote</a>. Yes, that keynote. His goal was not to create a fancy mockup using the latest tools available, but to create a minimum viable product that could be <em>easily and effectively</em> communicated to others. Regardless, if the app is meant to function as a slide deck, John used a simple tool he was familiar with to get the job done. The goal is not to be enamored with the latest and greatest tools, but to focus on honing your product with the tools you have.</p>

<h2>Create emotional attachment by personalizing it</h2>

<p>At this point in our cohort, we&#39;re creating simplistic apps. But, we were challenged to constantly be thinking about how we can make our assigned projects, <em>our products</em>. The key in creating a winning product is having an emotional attachment to it, creating something that you <em>really</em> want. This is exactly what a start-up at Atlanta Tech Village did. Co-founders <a href="https://vergilis.co/stanley/">Stanley Vergilis</a> wanted a way to book tutoring students and <a href="https://vergilis.co/james/">James Loper</a> a better way to fix iPhone screens than his Craigslist post. So, they created <a href="https://vergilis.co/">Vergilis</a>. The key, they created something they <em>wanted</em>. Do this and passion will be inevitable.</p>

        Going Further, Faster
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>I think John summed it up well in his recent blog <a href="http://john.do/dream-big-dreams/">post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, perhaps, most importantly is that fact that this [cohort] model enables the individual to go further, faster. They can build momentum like thereâ€™s no tomorrow, and they realize that they were far more capable than they ever dared to hope and believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Up and Running</h2>

<p>We put this into practice today as we ventured into our first day of RubyOnRails. My fellow Rubyist and I realized that we could go <em>further</em>, <em>faster</em> by working together. And, we did! By collaborating, we were able to work together to get our first Ruby install up and running much faster than we would have on our own!</p>

    <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>In my past positions, when undertaking a project I gathered a team, sometimes volunteers and sometimes paid, and figured how we would get the job done. Being a part of a team has allowed me to see some <em>incredible</em> things accomplished. Without question, the &quot;task&quot; was <em>always</em> completed far better with the help of my team than I could have done myself. Though my experiences at The Iron Yard are largely a personal challenge, I realize that <strong>no man is an island unto himself</strong>. Here&#39;s &quot;my team&quot; that has already helped me immensely.</p>

<h2>Cheerleaders</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t care who you are, having a cheerleader that is pulling for you will push you to achieve more <em>than you ever thought possible</em>. My cheerleaders are my family. We heard (pun intended) a lot about <a href="http://nfl.si.com/2014/01/15/seattle-seahawks-centurylink-field-noise/">CenturyLink Field</a> this past football seasonâ€”how the record-breaking decibel-level of fans helped the Seahawks win the Super Bowl. The fans had a part in the Seahawks success. When setting out to accomplish something new, there are times of discouragement, disbelief, and defeat. The Facetime chats from my wife and son, emails from my parents and in-laws, and texts from my extended family encourage me along the way. You need someone to believe in you and remind you that you <em>can do it</em>.</p>

<h2>A Veteran</h2>

<p>A mentor is an experienced or trusted advisor. Mine is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/galanbridgman">Galan Bridgman</a>. We have been friends for years, and though he doesn&#39;t know Ruby or Rails specifically, he&#39;s been been coding for well over twenty years. He know&#39;s what it is like to learn code and, more importantly, to learn to <em>think like a programmer</em>. He has made himself available to offer practical advice that has been applicable to every programming language. He often looks at my code and offers suggestions of how to make things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#x27;t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, fix typos, and reminds me of validations that I overlooked. Find an advisor who has been there, done that and can offer practical advice to overcome hurdles they too faced.</p>

<h2>A Coach</h2>

<p>Find someone who knows their stuff and can help you learn it. The leader of our cohort at The Iron Yard is <a href="http://shelbyswitzer.com/">Shelby Switzer</a>. Though I committed to attend The Iron Yard before I knew Shelby would be my teacher, I was excited to learn she would be the one teaching. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I am still pretty starstruck that I got <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">@switzerly</a> to teach Ruby at <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIronYard">@TheIronYard</a>. Lucky us and lucky students! She&#39;s a joy to work with.</p>&mdash; Mason Stewart (@masondesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/masondesu/statuses/455122730921508864">April 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Why? She&#39;s a self-taught Rubyist that has only been coding for a short time. She relates to us learning &quot;late.&quot; Because of this, she draws from her own experiences and knows how much we are capable of, pushing us accordingly. In addition, she taught English as a second-language to children in Nepal which is so important because programming is a language.</p>

<h2>Teammates</h2>

<p>Your &quot;teammates&quot; are those who have set out to accomplish the same exact thing as you. My teammates are those who are a part of the spring <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/">Rails cohort</a> at The Iron Yard. We are in it together, day in and day out. We learn together, work together, and laugh together (which is essential, <em>trust me</em>). We all live on HipChat, where we can send out a call for help or post some memes for comic relief. There are times when you can lift up a fellow teammate teammates and others are accessible to help you understand what they too struggled with. </p>

<p>No matter what you set out to accomplish, there is always value in building a team that, in turn, can help build you up. Setting out to achieve something great? <em>Build a great team</em>.</p>
