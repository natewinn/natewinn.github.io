  <p>&quot;What does what mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cohort....you said you&#39;re going to be a part of a &quot;cohort&quot; at The Iron Yard. I&#39;m just curious what that means?&quot;</p>

<p>This was a pretty typical response I heard when telling friends and family of my plans of attending <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/">The Iron Yard</a>. I honestly couldn&#39;t give a good response to those who asked me about the term &quot;cohort&quot;. Now nearing the two month mark at The Iron Yard in Atlanta, I <em>now</em> understand why the word &quot;cohort&quot; is far more than a cliche describing those attending The Iron Yard Coding Academy.</p>

<h2>United in Battle</h2>

<p>The word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(Roman_military_unit">cohort</a> comes from the latin <em>cohors</em> referring to a tactical unit in the Roman army during the first and second centuries. The 480 men making up a &quot;cohort&quot; were organized and commanded by one ranking official. They were inseparable. United both in life and battle. Everything was approached <em>together</em>. It should then come as no surprise why the organizational structure of the Roman military is still regarded as a model for modern militaries. The success stems <em>directly</em> from the success of the cohort model.</p>

<p>And that is why &quot;cohort&quot; is the only fitting term for my fellow coders at The Iron Yard. Over the past 8 weeks, we have done far more than sit in the same classroom. We have become family pressing toward a common goal, striving to reach an elusive prizeâ€”not individually racing to be the first to cross the finish line, but rather choosing to endure the marathon together. The Iron Yard is <strong>by far</strong> the most emotionally draining challenge of my life. Finishing would <em>not be possible</em> without having fellow comrades facing the same battle.</p>

<h2>In the Trenches</h2>

<p>Before making a final decision to attend The Iron Yard, I scoured the internet to hopefully read the experiences of people who attended similar <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140520-713891.html">bootcamps</a>. Unfortunately, I could find very little. I wondered why. It&#39;s <em>very</em> apparent now. With little time to even sleep, it has proven to be a challenge to record my thoughts. Regardless, I wanted to give those who come behind me <em>a look into the trenches</em>, not just from my perspective, but also from those in my cohort.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks, I will be personally interviewing each member of my cohort. It is my hope to shed some light on just how incredibly <em>challenging</em>, yet <em>rewarding</em>, this experience has been thus far. My hope is the interviews will be a help to those who consider attending.</p>
