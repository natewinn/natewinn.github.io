  <h1 class="post-title">Meet Ryan Snodgrass</h1>
  <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2014</span>
  <p>Ryan Snodgrass is the <em>third</em> interview from the members of <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/">The Iron Yard - Atlanta Rails</a> cohort.</p>

<h2>What were you up to before coming to The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>I went to the University of Central Florida and got a degree in cinema studies. Completely unrelated to programming. In fact, I took a Java or JavaScript class while I was there. I think it was Java. . . I really don&#39;t remember. But, I do remember I <em>bombed</em> it. I failed the class within the first month. Nothing really materialized with my degree so, I found myself working at a call center in Orlando, Florida. It was like the worst job in the world.</p>

<p>I have told this story so many times now, but the position was contract to hire. If I worked hard enough, they would hire me as a full-time employee. But, I knew by taking the position, it was going to be a couple of months before I would be offered a position. A couple of months passed, and I still didn&#39;t get hired. The thing about a call center is you have just what you need to do your job. You are trained to know <em>exactly</em> how to find specific answers. So, after working for a while, you master the tools and get comfortable with what&#39;s going on. And then they say, &quot;Surprise, this department doesn&#39;t need you anymore, but we like you enough that we are going to move you to another department.&quot; After the the third time this happened to me, I became <em>very frustrated with what I was doing</em>. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been technically savvy, building my own computers and running Linux, nothing major, but definitely more technical stuff than the average Joe would attempt. I tried to get into the tech department at the call center. I had a friend who was one of the recruiters for that department and even recommended that I interview for a position. I went in for an interview, and they liked me. But, they eventually hired someone with more experience. So, about a year ago, I knew I would have to <em>do something different</em> to get a position I desired. I began learning programming on my own with <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Tree House</a>, and things like that, but it seemed like it was just taking forever. </p>

<h2>Why did you choose The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>Mom and dad live up here in Atlanta. They actually just recently moved here. I was living in Orlando, and my parents didn&#39;t like that too much. Mom wanted me to move to Atlanta and in time raise a family here. You know she&#39;s hoping for grandkids one day. Dad found an article from the Business Journal that highlighted <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/">The Iron Yard</a>. He knew I was learning to code on my own and encouraged me to look into it. I started looking into other thing that were written about The Iron Yard, and all I could find were stellar reviews. I couldn&#39;t believe the guaranteed job placement. The <a href="http://theironyard.com/">website</a> looked amazing so, I took a shot and applied to it. The next thing I know, <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington">John Saddington</a> called me up. I really didn&#39;t look into any other bootcamps or programs. Mom and dad said, &quot;Listen, if you come up to Atlanta, you can live with us for free, and we will pay for your class.&quot; How could I turn that down? I mean don&#39;t get me wrong, I researched The Iron Yard heavily, but I never considered another program. Everything that I saw or read about The Iron Yard was very positive. I felt that I didn&#39;t have to look any further than The Iron Yard. </p>

<h2>So why Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, I was a cinema major in college and had a strong visual background. I also knew from college that there were people far more creative than I was and far more talented at design than I could ever be. So, in light of that <em>I felt back-end development would be a better fit for me</em>. When I was in high school, I had never drawn before. I was really bad at drawing, but somehow I developed an ability for still life drawing. Surprisingly, I became one of the best artists in my high school. One of my drawings actually won second place in a state wide art festival. Really cool, right? So, I think to myself, &quot;Yeah, I am a real rockstar. I&#39;m the best in my high school, I&#39;m best in the state.&quot; Then, I get to college and realize just how talented the other artists are around me were. I knew that I could never compete with them. I understand it&#39;s not a competition, but I definitely wasn&#39;t as good as I thought I was. I took that into consideration when choosing Rails, and I believe I made the right choice. I really enjoy the problem solving. <em>It&#39;s like I&#39;m solving puzzles all day</em>. </p>

<h2>Expectations vs. actual experience?</h2>

<p>I knew The Iron Yard was going to be exceptionally hard. I will say that my classmates are a lot <em>less</em> nerdy than I thought they would be. On a side note, I&#39;m really surprised at how many married people there are in the class. That was definitely surprising. I just assumed everyone would be young and single. For the most part though, everyone is kind of the same, mid 20s to early 30s, intelligent. Everyone here is really intelligent; it&#39;s very obvious. And everyone is really nice. There are very broad backgrounds. We&#39;ve got Jeff who is an engineer. I studied cinema. Sid a chemical engineer. Chris worked in non-profits. Dave worked for the DoD. Dan did marketing. <em>Such a broad range of backgrounds which has definitely made things interesting</em>.</p>

<h2>Best advice for those considering a coding bootcamp?</h2>

<p>Prepare as much as you possibly can! I found out about The Iron Yard a month before it began so, I didn&#39;t have much time to prepare. Though, I did do quite a bit on <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Tree House</a> prior to my arrival. I completed the Ruby track on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> before attending with John&#39;s recommendation. I hear <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/book">Michael Hartl&#39;s tutorials</a> are really good. Definitely get familiar with the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> docs. We use them a lot! Ruby docs will be used day 1.</p>

<p>Be prepared to work very long and very hard. Realize that you&#39;re not going to have a life for three month. It seems like that I&#39;m working non-stop but, I make it a point to not code on Sunday. <em>It&#39;s a chance to hit the reset button</em>. But, it is honestly hard to not think about code. Last Sunday, I went to the Atlanta History Museum with my family, and I found myself thinking about code. Specifically, Ajax. I was wondering how I could get past a specific problem I was struggling with. But, I do my best to try put those thoughts in the back of my mind and rest my mind for at least one day a week. </p>

<h2>What do you enjoy most about The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>Free beer. Wait . . . is this thing recording? In all honesty, the tools The Iron Yard provides for us—24-hour access to <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">ATV</a>, the guest speakers, John Saddington, the meet-ups, and opportunities like <a href="http://atlanta.startupweekend.org/">start-up weekend</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/timwco/status/475279395738124288/photo/1">hack-a-thons</a>. The Atlanta Tech Village, where we have our classes, is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s a fantastic building with some incredible amenities. But, by far, the student body is the best! Everyone here is so much fun to be around and just hang out. We often <em>waste</em> time just sitting around chatting and I enjoy every minute of it. We&#39;re all in this thing together, there&#39;s no room for egos. We all pick each other up and that creates a really positive environment.</p>

<h2>Your experience before coming to The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>Failing Java, haha. </p>

<h2>Where do you see yourself going from here?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been so focused lately, that I haven&#39;t even thought about it. <em>And believe me, that&#39;s a good thing</em>. The last thing you need is something to distract you from coding. I haven&#39;t even thought of the big picture once I&#39;m done. I&#39;d love to get a job overseas in some place exotic. Working as a developer in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Venice, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tokyo, Okinawa, or Osaka would be awesome. I really like the idea that as a developer, I can work remotely from anywhere. </p>
