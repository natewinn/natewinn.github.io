    <p>This Wednesday we dove head first into HTML and CSS with our Teaching Assistant, Katy. Working as a designer in the past, I&#39;ve mocked up quite a few website to be coded. Though I&#39;ve learned best practices to pass off mockups to a developer, I regretably never took the time to learn how to properly code the designs myself. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, we were challenged to code an intricate <a href="http://natewinn.github.io/public/assets/2014-04-13-pixel-for-pixel.png" target="_blank">mockup</a>. A similar design to what I may have designed in the past. Our cohort was challenged to replicated the site <em>pixel for pixel</em> using HTML and CSS. By the end of the first day, I was able to wrap my head around the syntax and grid system. From there, I was off to the races...</p>

<h2>Learn and Apply</h2>

<p>Though parts were painfully slow and frustrating. I was kicking myself the entire time for not forcing myself to learn this sooner! The challenge had always been daunting, too difficult to begin. But here, you are expected to make things happen—to learn and apply the skills <em>very quickly</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always had a critical eye regarding design, especially my own. Tirelessly working with developers to ensure the final layout would match what I created in Photoshop. It has definitely been a challenge to be on the other side of the table. Spending hours adjusting seemingly insignificant objects to ensure the final design was pixel for pixel definitely gave me <em>a new appreciation for coding</em>. Take a look at the final <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/natewinn/mobber/blob/master/index.html">page</a>. </p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Exactly one year ago today, I created an account at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> and began filling out an application in hopes of joining an upcoming cohort. But that very same night, I began to reason with myself why I would never be able to attend.</p>

<h2>Excuses, Excuses</h2>

<p>Of course, I had plenty of excuses. In just three months, my wife and I were expecting our first child, I had no where near the money I needed for entry, and then there was the small detail of supporting my family without any income for three months! My aspirations of attending a coding bootcamp became a distant memory. I was twenty-nine years-old and accepted the fact that my time to do work that truly excited me had past. I came to accept it.</p>

<p>Shortly after the first of the year, I was casually browsing through Twitter and noticed <a href="http://john.do/">John Saddington</a>, whom I have been following for years, mention <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly googled “The Iron Yard,” and my curiosity was instantly peaked. I immediately emailed John, and it just so happened that he was going to be in San Francisco (only a 30 minute drive from my home) the very next day to speak at a conference. </p>

<h2>My Year</h2>

<p>While grabbing sushi together that next evening, John told me just a handful of the amazing stories of people in my similar situation that had attended The Iron Yard. In just a 3-month period of time, people were completely changing the course of their lives. Just before I hopped into my car to drive home from the city that evening, John tweeted this...</p>

<p><img><p align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Make this the year. Don’t let it go to waste.</p>&mdash; John Saddington (@saddington) <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington/statuses/428403179722506240">January 29, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>That night, I decided this was going to be my year! Today, exactly one year from the day I registered at Dev Bootcamp, I’m writing this post from inside <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a>. Though only one week into the Rails dev cohort, I’ve already been challenged, stretched, and pushed more in this short period than I ever have in my entire life!</p>

        How to Win the Internet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington">John Saddington</a>, partner at The Iron Yard, stopped by to chat with the Ruby and iOS cohorts about <em>Winning the Internet</em>. His challenge to us was simple. <strong>Be in control of our brand online</strong>. Each of us have the power to curate what people find when Googling our name. </p>

<h2>Still Learning</h2>

<p>Because competition has become so fierce in the marketplace, you must show others why you are different, what sets you a part from the pack. The goal is not to show others that you are an expert, but to show others <em>your constant pursuit in becoming an expert</em>. This is precisely the reason I entitled this blog, &quot;Still Learning.&quot; The more I learn, the more I realize how much more I have to learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are people that do and there are people that dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To <em>Win the Internet</em>, John challenged us with four practical thoughts about how we can make ourselves stand out in a crowd.</p>

<h2>Capture a thought and tell others.</h2>

<p>Take one specific thing and show people that you understand it. Then, take that <strong>a step further</strong>. Prove you are able to take what you&#39;ve learned and help others understand it. It is easy to comprehend a topic for yourself, but to be able to transfer that knowledge in a <em>clear, relatable message</em> to someone else is invaluable.</p>

<h2>Don’t be afraid to be unique.</h2>

<p>Being unique is what sets you apart from the pack. Having an opinion and telling others how you really feel is important! Apple has become an industry leader with <a href="http://www.thecrazyones.it/spot-en.html">Think Different</a>. Their entire company culture is built around challenging the status quo. Companies are looking for people who *care, and having an opinion proves you are passionate about whatever you undertake.</p>

<h2>Talk about how your are improving.</h2>

<p>Show others that you are a <em>lifelong learner</em>. When put in the proper perspective, every experience has the opportunity to be a teachable moment. This shows others that you are not interested in just existing, but consistently striving to improve yourself and others around you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone that you meet knows something you don&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one likes working with a know it all! And by telling others what you are attempting to learn, you prove to others you <em>have not arrived</em>.</p>

<h2>Prove you can be an ambassador</h2>

<p>Effective communication is arguably the most valued asset to a company. By having a message online, you are effectively an ambassador for yourself. By communicating the value of your own personal brand, you are proving <em>ahead of time</em> that you can transfer that to whatever company you work for.</p>

<p>I was challenged to tailor the images and content that returned when people search for me online. I want people to be wowed when googling &quot;Nate Winn.&quot; How are you winning the internet?</p>

    <p>Day one of The Iron Yard has come to an end. After some preliminary announcements and a quick tour of the awesome <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a>, we hit the ground running. Actually, it was more like <em>sprinting</em>.</p>

<h2>Rolling with Ruby</h2>

<p>We quickly got our MacBooks on the same page using <a href="http://installrails.com/">InstallRails.com</a>. I found this site when I completed <a href="http://onemonthrails.com/signup?discount_code=EGkdkT">One Month Rails</a> before coming to The Iron Yard. InstallRails will quickly guide you through the process of installing all the tools you need to get RubyOnRails up and running on a Mac, PC, or Linux install. I would <em>highly recommend</em> it if you&#39;re not quite sure what you need to get Rails up and running. We spent the remaining class time covering arrays and I was pretty much lost...</p>

<h2>Guess Who?</h2>

<p>Our first assignment was to create a guessing game in Ruby that runs in the terminal with the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Array of options</li>
<li>Randomly select option for user to guess</li>
<li>Give hints to user</li>
<li>Do not define your own methods or classes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Finally!</h2>

<p>It&#39;s just after 12:00am, and I <em>just</em> got my app to work! Check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926">gist</a> on GitHub. To be completely honest, I&#39;m not quite sure how in the world I got this to work. If this is what every day will be like, I&#39;m in for a <em>wild ride</em>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>When venturing out to accomplish something new there is always an equal amount of <strong>excitement</strong> and <strong>fear</strong>. And that&#39;s exactly the feeling I have as I sit here on Southwest Flight #WN564. </p>

<figure><figcaption>Flying to the ATL for The Iron Yard</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Just a few hours ago, I left everything familiar to me—my family, home, and job to travel <em>sight unseen</em> to Atlanta, Georgia to attend <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>. As I fly across the country, I can&#39;t help but contemplate what lies in store for the next 12 weeks. I&#39;m genuinely looking forward to blogging about my journey to becoming a coder. </p>

<h2>A Helping Hand</h2>

<p>My decision to attend a coding bootcamp was heavily influenced by others who have already taken the leap of faith to attend a bootcamp, especially, <a href="http://www.colorturtle.com/">Daniel Donaldson</a>. Daniel went out of his way to transparently answer practical questions I had. Just by him blogging about his experiences and the obstacles he overcame to attend, I was <em>challenged to do the same</em>. Hopefully, my experiences will be a challenge and motivation to others who are struggling with the same decision I faced.</p>
