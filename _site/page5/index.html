        How to Win the Internet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington">John Saddington</a>, partner at The Iron Yard, stopped by to chat with the Ruby and iOS cohorts about <em>Winning the Internet</em>. His challenge to us was simple. <strong>Be in control of our brand online</strong>. Each of us have the power to curate what people find when Googling our name. </p>

<h2>Still Learning</h2>

<p>Because competition has become so fierce in the marketplace, you must show others why you are different, what sets you a part from the pack. The goal is not to show others that you are an expert, but to show others <em>your constant pursuit in becoming an expert</em>. This is precisely the reason I entitled this blog, &quot;Still Learning.&quot; The more I learn, the more I realize how much more I have to learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are people that do and there are people that dream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To <em>Win the Internet</em>, John challenged us with four practical thoughts about how we can make ourselves stand out in a crowd.</p>

<h2>Capture a thought and tell others.</h2>

<p>Take one specific thing and show people that you understand it. Then, take that <strong>a step further</strong>. Prove you are able to take what you&#39;ve learned and help others understand it. It is easy to comprehend a topic for yourself, but to be able to transfer that knowledge in a <em>clear, relatable message</em> to someone else is invaluable.</p>

<h2>Don’t be afraid to be unique.</h2>

<p>Being unique is what sets you apart from the pack. Having an opinion and telling others how you really feel is important! Apple has become an industry leader with <a href="http://www.thecrazyones.it/spot-en.html">Think Different</a>. Their entire company culture is built around challenging the status quo. Companies are looking for people who *care, and having an opinion proves you are passionate about whatever you undertake.</p>

<h2>Talk about how your are improving.</h2>

<p>Show others that you are a <em>lifelong learner</em>. When put in the proper perspective, every experience has the opportunity to be a teachable moment. This shows others that you are not interested in just existing, but consistently striving to improve yourself and others around you. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone that you meet knows something you don&#39;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No one likes working with a know it all! And by telling others what you are attempting to learn, you prove to others you <em>have not arrived</em>.</p>

<h2>Prove you can be an ambassador</h2>

<p>Effective communication is arguably the most valued asset to a company. By having a message online, you are effectively an ambassador for yourself. By communicating the value of your own personal brand, you are proving <em>ahead of time</em> that you can transfer that to whatever company you work for.</p>

<p>I was challenged to tailor the images and content that returned when people search for me online. I want people to be wowed when googling &quot;Nate Winn.&quot; How are you winning the internet?</p>

    <p>Day one of The Iron Yard has come to an end. After some preliminary announcements and a quick tour of the awesome <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a>, we hit the ground running. Actually, it was more like <em>sprinting</em>.</p>

<h2>Rolling with Ruby</h2>

<p>We quickly got our MacBooks on the same page using <a href="http://installrails.com/">InstallRails.com</a>. I found this site when I completed <a href="http://onemonthrails.com/signup?discount_code=EGkdkT">One Month Rails</a> before coming to The Iron Yard. InstallRails will quickly guide you through the process of installing all the tools you need to get RubyOnRails up and running on a Mac, PC, or Linux install. I would <em>highly recommend</em> it if you&#39;re not quite sure what you need to get Rails up and running. We spent the remaining class time covering arrays and I was pretty much lost...</p>

<h2>Guess Who?</h2>

<p>Our first assignment was to create a guessing game in Ruby that runs in the terminal with the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>Array of options</li>
<li>Randomly select option for user to guess</li>
<li>Give hints to user</li>
<li>Do not define your own methods or classes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Finally!</h2>

<p>It&#39;s just after 12:00am, and I <em>just</em> got my app to work! Check out the <a href="https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926">gist</a> on GitHub. To be completely honest, I&#39;m not quite sure how in the world I got this to work. If this is what every day will be like, I&#39;m in for a <em>wild ride</em>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>When venturing out to accomplish something new there is always an equal amount of <strong>excitement</strong> and <strong>fear</strong>. And that&#39;s exactly the feeling I have as I sit here on Southwest Flight #WN564. </p>

<p>Just a few hours ago, I left everything familiar to me—my family, home, and job to travel <em>sight unseen</em> to Atlanta, Georgia to attend <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>. As I fly across the country, I can&#39;t help but contemplate what lies in store for the next 12 weeks. I&#39;m genuinely looking forward to blogging about my journey to becoming a coder. </p>

<h2>A Helping Hand</h2>

<p>My decision to attend a coding bootcamp was heavily influenced by others who have already taken the leap of faith to attend a bootcamp, especially, <a href="http://www.colorturtle.com/">Daniel Donaldson</a>. Daniel went out of his way to transparently answer practical questions I had. Just by him blogging about his experiences and the obstacles he overcame to attend, I was <em>challenged to do the same</em>. Hopefully, my experiences will be a challenge and motivation to others who are struggling with the same decision I faced.</p>
