        Meet Jeff Scholen
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Jeff Scholen is the <em>second</em> interview from the members of <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/">The Iron Yard - Atlanta Rails</a> cohort.</p>

<h2>What were you up to before coming to The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>Last December, I lost my job and began immediately looking for another one. Around that same time, I saw an advertisement of some kind about The Iron Yard beginning in March of this year. I <em>immediately</em> knew it was something I wanted to do. At that point, it was more of a pipe dream. March was too far away, and I needed to land a job well before then. I had been laid off before, so I wasn&#39;t too worried about getting another job rather quickly. So, I buried The Iron Yard in the back of my mind and began interviewing for other positions. By mid-February, my prospects of finding a job were still pretty bleak, and I realized the timing of <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/">The Iron Yard</a> might seem more realistic.</p>

<p>The thought of attending worried me. So much so, that I never approached my wife, Tracey, about it. I can remember we were driving in the car one day, and she asked me, &quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; I knew the twelve weeks would be more of a burden on her than me. But, our decision in me attending goes back to 2009.</p>

<p>Back in 2009, I wanted to get a MacBook Pro. My wife and I weren&#39;t struggling financially, but we just didn&#39;t have a lot of extra savings. When I approached her about buying the computer, she got kind of upset. She said, &quot;We don&#39;t have a lot of money, and you want to go get a $2,000 computer?&quot; Shortly after that, she came back to me and said, &quot;God is just asking me to have an open hand with you about this, and so if you want to get that computer go ahead and get it.&quot; So, I went out and got it the very next day. When opened up my new MacBook Pro for the first time, I immediately noticed a problem. The cord that came with it was very annoying to manage. I quickly came up with an idea to keep my cord wrapped up and posted it on <a href="https://www.quirky.com/">Quirky</a>. They chose to produce my idea, and I became an inventor. As a result, I have made about $90,000 in royalties over the last four years. Her small decision to let go and let me buy this computer resulted in the payout.</p>

<p>When she asked me that day what I was thinking about, I told her about The Iron Yard. So, instead of throwing up her hands, <em>she kept asking questions</em>. I was completely unaware that she had been meeting with a friend whose husband had been out of work for over a year during their marriage. The advice she gave my wife was to keep an open hand since she didn&#39;t know what God might be doing in my life. As a result, my wife didn&#39;t put up any roadblocks.</p>

<p>I met with <a href="http://john.do/about/">John Saddington</a> shortly after that, and he seemed to be positive about me attending. Because I was still looking for a job, I still questioned if it was a real opportunity. If God wanted me to move in this direction, <em>He was going to have to kind of open all the doors</em>. Over the next few weeks, I had several phone interviews, a lot of them positive, but every door closed. It was like one thing after another. A week before the class started Kimberly Clark called me and said they wanted to bring me back to interview for another position. But, they ended up offering that job to someone internally. I took that as an affirmation of God opening up one final door. I had confidence that attending <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIronYard">The Iron Yard</a> was what I was supposed to be doing. There were other things that aligned too. Finances worked out. My dad agreed to pay for the class. Knowing the struggle it was going to be, my wife was one hundred precent in favor to go.</p>

<h2>Why did you choose The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>I had heard about The Iron Yard doing something in <a href="http://greenville.theironyard.com/">Greenville</a>, so I was hoping they would eventually come to Atlanta. When I heard in December they were starting in <a href="http://atlanta.theironyard.com/">Atlanta</a>, I thought it might be a possibility. Because of John Saddington&#39;s involvement in Atlanta and knowing his reputation for excellence, I knew I could trust him to put something together—<em>something awesome</em>. I really didn&#39;t know of any other bootcamps in the Atlanta area like there were in other parts of the country. Going to a distant state to attend a bootcamp would have been incredibly impractical for my wife and three kids. So, the Atlanta location was perfect for me.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>I began working for a startup back in 2007. It was a medical device company that created a device which interfaced with a Rails backend. I soon became friends with one of the programmers there. We had a lot in common and even went to the same church together. He started showing me Rails, because I was interested in software as more of a hobby at the time. The more he talked to me about Rails, the more I began to read about it. I began to toy with it by working through Michael Hartle&#39;s Tutorials on Rails. As I went through the tutorials, I would gain some momentum and then would quickly fall behind because life and work got in the way. <em>I knew I needed something more</em> disciplined if I were to really learn Rails.</p>

<h2>Expectations vs. actual experience?</h2>

<p>My wife and I established up front that it would be many late nights and difficult weekends. But, I think it has been less stressful for her because I have made the decision to leave ATV around 4pm everyday to help her with the kids. For her, it&#39;s still a burden when the kids go to bed. I basically check out and do my homework until late in the evening. So, there&#39;s very little quality time we spend together. I anticipated I would be spending a lot more time on the weekends doing homework but, it&#39;s just tough to do that. <em>I have decided to simply do the best I possibly can</em>. </p>

<h2>What do you enjoy most about The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>I love the environment. I have worked for a couple of companies that didn&#39;t really care for the employees. <strong>I feel like The Iron Yard is a place of generosity and outpouring where people are being cared for</strong>. It&#39;s the kind of culture I really want to be a part of. And <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/about/mission">ATV</a> is no different. This place maintains a culture where they want to see us succeed. I really like our instructor, <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">Shelby</a>; she&#39;s been great. I love the class; it&#39;s tough, but I&#39;m truly enjoying the process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I&#39;m really learning what I&#39;ve wanted to learn for the past five years. My dream is becoming a reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My strong suit is troubleshooting, and this has been troubleshooting on steroids. Even though it&#39;s tough at times and you want to pull your hair out, I feel like I&#39;m really learning what I&#39;ve wanted to learn for the past five years. My dream is becoming a reality. Often times, you will feel overwhelmed and wonder if you&#39;ll have the skills you need to get a job done. <em>But, I have determined to just learn as much as I possibly can and have fun while learning it.</em> </p>

<h2>How much experience did you have before starting?</h2>

<p>Even preparing was difficult. I knew I couldn&#39;t spend all my time preparing when I knew I was about to be busier than I had ever been before. So, I had to <em>balance my time carefully</em>. Aside from doing the Code Academy, I kind of reviewed Michael Hartle&#39;s course and read some blogposts about Ruby and Rails. <strong>I have absolutely no programming background</strong>. I took a couple of courses in Pascal when I was in college, but that was 20 years ago. And even then, I didn&#39;t do too well. I just didn&#39;t get programming back then. But, when I began going through Code Academy tutorials I thought, &quot;Yeah I can do this.&quot; I can remember John telling me when I met with him, &quot;If you simply can&#39;t do it, we can&#39;t help you. But, if you can struggle through it and get it done,&quot; he assured me The Iron Yard could provide me with the tools to learn Rails. </p>

<h2>Best advice for those considering a coding bootcamp?</h2>

<p>My best advice would be to just <em>clear your calendar</em>. If you have family, make sure they understand. Honestly, I wish I were single doing this because that would have given me a much better opportunity to learn. Just be prepared to work hard and cry a lot. </p>

<h2>Where do you see yourself going from here?</h2>

<p>I had two motivations for doing this. One, I&#39;ve wanted to learn programming for years; and two, <em>I have the desire to build my own applications</em>. And, of course I get little ideas here and there. I already have the ability to follow through on those in a tangible way. I would ultimately like to find a company with a good culture and a good fit, and a salary that I can live on—and still on the side build my own app. Long term, I have always wanted to be in business for myself, so I&#39;d love to be able to start a company. </p>

        Meet Chris Turner
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Chris Turner is the <em>first</em> interview from the members of <a href="http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/">The Iron Yard - Atlanta Rails</a> cohort.</p>

<h2>What were you up to before coming to The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>I started a non-profit organization in high school and continued to build it through college. In fact, non-profits interested me so much, I got a masters degree in non-profit management. Every non-profit organization does some type of fundraising, and that quickly became my niche. I did fundraising for two different organizations in Augusta prior to moving to Atlanta to take a consulting gig for an area non-profit.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a post on my <a href="https://medium.com/@empowerchris/1245f3830c55">blog</a> about this recent experience. I consulted on a fundraising project for an organization that was teaching kids how to be entrepreneurs. The organization was called Georgia Real. I had signed on to raise $100,000 from September to the end of the year. When I came on board, I spent a ton of time bringing them up to speed. They were way behind on what needed to be done to make the project a success. So, I helped them update their financials, produce marketing materials, and establish a social media presence. That alone took about a month and a half, but I knew it was essential if the project was going to be a success. I then built relationships with potential donors. Just one week prior to my deadline, I had received $200,000 in pledges! The next week, my deadline, <em>all of the donors fell through</em>. Everything fell apart. My wife didn&#39;t have a job at the time, so we were left with nothing.</p>

<p>I began looking around to figure out what <em>I wanted to do with my life</em>. I was fed up with fundraising at that point. I found The Iron Yard, and it aligned with my desire to be an entrepreneur. I had always wanted to get projects off the ground, to build my own stuff. The Iron Yard seemed like just the right place for me. My ultimate goal is to create an organization to inspire and empower kids to create things. So, I figured what a better way than to create the tools I need myself. </p>

<h2>Why did you choose The Iron Yard?</h2>

<p>I&#39;m guilty of over researching things. When I found out about The Iron Yard, I looked into every similar program imaginable. It kinda drives my wife crazy. I considered going to Greenville for The Iron Yard front-end program. In fact, I had actually selected the front-end program until it was decided the Atlanta location wasn&#39;t going to offer a front-end program right away. So, I changed my mind back to the Rails track and committed to the Atlanta location. But, I definitely did my research before I came. I ultimately chose <a href="http://atlanta.theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard - Atlanta</a> because it made the most sense for my situation.</p>

<h2>Why Ruby on Rails?</h2>

<p>Rails wasn&#39;t my first choice, to be quite honest. My personality is much more inclined to design, and I don&#39;t really have an engineer&#39;s mindset. I&#39;m much more of the free spirit type. I initially made the decision to pursue the front-end track because I thought it would be a better fit for me. But, <em>choosing Ruby has been a blessing</em>. I find that I am much more capable of teaching myself the front-end aspect of development. I know learning Rails now is eventually going to make me a more well-rounded developer. I would never have taken the time to learn all the Rails, AJAX, and database stuff myself.</p>

<h2>Expectations vs. actual experience?</h2>

<p>I really made sure I had a good understanding of what I was getting myself into. I talked to John a good bit before committing to attend. I asked him exactly what the process was like. I made sure that I reaffirmed my own concerns about not having an engineer&#39;s mindset, that I wouldn&#39;t have a problem developing an analytical approach to coding. John said <em>it would be one of the hardest things that I had ever done</em>. But, as long as I was dedicated to do what I said I wanted to do, I would make it through. John talked much about the relationships that I would create at The Iron Yard. Any time you go through a challenging experience with other people, you build close relationships much faster. This has definitely exceeded my expectations. <strong>I didn&#39;t expect to create such good relationships with those in my cohort</strong>. I know everyone in our class on a much deeper, personal level than any other person I have only known for just 7 weeks. It&#39;s been really cool to watch these relationships grow and develop.</p>

<h2>Best advice for those considering a coding bootcamp?</h2>

<p>This has been my challenge—understand that people are coming into this with different levels of experience. <strong>Do not compare yourself to them!</strong> I still fight this every day. You have to constantly remind yourself and tell yourself over and over again that as long as you&#39;re trying as hard as you possibly can, you&#39;re okay. <em>Put in your absolute best effort and be fine with that</em>. There are going to be people that come into the program that have a whole lot more experience than you. You must have the mindset that you don&#39;t suck just because they seem to be doing slightly better than you in some way. You must realize that we&#39;re good at different things too. I feel like I am improving my design skills with each new project. So, there are days when I&#39;m really proud of the design and disappointed with my code. Someone sitting next to me may admire my design, but in reality his code may way better than mine! <em>Constantly avoid envy at all costs</em>. </p>

<h2>Where do you see yourself going from here?</h2>

<p>Working from the back, forward . . . my ultimate goal is to start a company with what I&#39;ve learned and have the ability to launch ideas when I think of them. Because of my situation, I need to find somewhat of a permanent position to have some stability in my marriage. So, the perfect scenario is that I would finish and move into a company that has an entrepreneurial mindset. <em>I want to continue to learn and be challenged</em> with difficult assignments and tasks. I would ultimately like to learn more of the front-end as well and add those skills to what I&#39;ve learned at <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a> to become a solid full-stack developer. Working for a company that would also allow me to expand in that area would be awesome!</p>

        Coding Cohort
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2014</span>

    <p>&quot;What does what mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cohort....you said you&#39;re going to be a part of a &quot;cohort&quot; at The Iron Yard. I&#39;m just curious what that means?&quot;</p>

<p>This was a pretty typical response I heard when telling friends and family of my plans of attending <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/">The Iron Yard</a>. I honestly couldn&#39;t give a good response to those who asked me about the term &quot;cohort&quot;. Now nearing the two month mark at The Iron Yard in Atlanta, I <em>now</em> understand why the word &quot;cohort&quot; is far more than a cliche describing those attending The Iron Yard Coding Academy.</p>

<h2>United in Battle</h2>

<p>The word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_(Roman_military_unit">cohort</a> comes from the latin <em>cohors</em> referring to a tactical unit in the Roman army during the first and second centuries. The 480 men making up a &quot;cohort&quot; were organized and commanded by one ranking official. They were inseparable. United both in life and battle. Everything was approached <em>together</em>. It should then come as no surprise why the organizational structure of the Roman military is still regarded as a model for modern militaries. The success stems <em>directly</em> from the success of the cohort model.</p>

<p>And that is why &quot;cohort&quot; is the only fitting term for my fellow coders at The Iron Yard. Over the past 8 weeks, we have done far more than sit in the same classroom. We have become family pressing toward a common goal, striving to reach an elusive prize—not individually racing to be the first to cross the finish line, but rather choosing to endure the marathon together. The Iron Yard is <strong>by far</strong> the most emotionally draining challenge of my life. Finishing would <em>not be possible</em> without having fellow comrades facing the same battle.</p>

<h2>In the Trenches</h2>

<p>Before making a final decision to attend The Iron Yard, I scoured the internet to hopefully read the experiences of people who attended similar <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140520-713891.html">bootcamps</a>. Unfortunately, I could find very little. I wondered why. It&#39;s <em>very</em> apparent now. With little time to even sleep, it has proven to be a challenge to record my thoughts. Regardless, I wanted to give those who come behind me <em>a look into the trenches</em>, not just from my perspective, but also from those in my cohort.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks, I will be personally interviewing each member of my cohort. It is my hope to shed some light on just how incredibly <em>challenging</em>, yet <em>rewarding</em>, this experience has been thus far. My hope is the interviews will be a help to those who consider attending.</p>
