    <p>Though I&#39;m 30-years-old and just now diving into coding, I realize there is no better time to learn than <strong>now</strong>. It&#39;s never <em>too late</em> to start learning. The landscape is changing so fast that <em>everyone</em> has to be continually learning the latest technologies. So, there&#39;s always a good spot to jump in. Don&#39;t let a late start discourage you from getting started! There&#39;s no better day than <strong>today</strong> to start learning.</p>

<p>Starbucks is my usual Sunday morning spot. I get there early to work on my weekend homework. This past Sunday, the New York Times caught my eye on the way in. This was on the front page:</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-16-the-language-of-the-future.jpg" alt="NYT Article - Reading, Writing, and Now Coding"></img><figure><figcaption>Parents and Educators are Realizing the Importance of Coding</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>It&#39;s cool to see kids getting excited about code and problem solving at such a young age. Many parents and educators are realizing that programming is the language of the future and kids better start learning <strong>now</strong>. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/us/reading-writing-arithmetic-and-lately-coding.html?_r=0">NYT article</a> goes on tell just how popular coding programs for kids are becoming. Kids are ditching video games for programs like <a href="http://turtleacademy.com/">Turtle Academy</a> and <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>. &quot;Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive.&quot;</p>

<h2>The Next Generation</h2>

<p>Though still just a beginner, I&#39;m looking forward to teaching at <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/scratch/">The Iron Yard Kids Academy</a> on May 29. It&#39;s going to be fun to spark an interest in future programmers. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a place to get started with code, for both kids and adults, you&#39;ll find an awesome list of resources <a href="https://medium.com/global-silicon-valley/a2dc04ea9529">here</a>. Jump in and get started today!</p>

    <p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a> is a newbie coder&#39;s best friend. But, when approaching a new concept don&#39;t head for that search bar just yet! Your first step <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> be to scour the web when you&#39;re setting out to tackle a new challenge. It&#39;s understandable that a new concept can be overwhelming, and the thought of trying to do something new can be daunting. But, instead of turning to the internet, try to breakdown the new challenge into actionable chunks that you <em>can</em> complete. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Logically think through what you have to accomplish and figure out the essential steps needed to accomplish those tasks. This happened <strong>today</strong> when we had to create a jQuery modal by ourselves. It was a daunting task when you see the code for most modals you find online. You see the code and think it <em>has</em> to be complicated and there&#39;s <em>no way</em> I can do that. And I fell right into the trap. When we came into class this morning, Shelby asked us to break it down. In reality, a modal can be accomplished as easy as using a javascript .on(&#39;click&#39;) on a .div set to display:none.</p>

<p>Try it for yourself first . . . even if you <em>know</em> you&#39;re going to fail. Once, you create your own iteration <a href="/2014/05/01/the-rubber-duck/">talk through it</a>. See if you can spot any errors errors. If not, then you can start searching. Before getting carried away and letting hours upon hours of time pass, here are <strong>six tips</strong> to finding a solution on Google.</p>

<h2>Guides First</h2>

<p>Turn to the docs/guides before you go anywhere else online. I&#39;ve mentioned before just how <a href="/2014/04/30/read-the-docs/">valuable</a> the docs can be. In all honesty, the docs are generally going to be the first thing that comes up with a Google search anyway. So, you might as well start there. You&#39;ll find <em>many</em> problems can be solved and <em>much</em> time can be saved by just looking at the docs. </p>

<h2>Be Specific</h2>

<p>If you strike out with the docs then jump on Google. Remember, generic searches won&#39;t shed any light on your problem. Take a second to accurately frame your search by <em>describing the problem</em> and <em>thinking of key search terms</em>; or else you&#39;ll quickly find yourself endlessly wading through irrelevant information. For example, I was trying to get a conirmation email to be sent to the user following new account creation using the Devise gem. Instead of searching &quot;Devise mail,&quot; I searched &quot;Rails Devise Mailer New Account Confirmation.&quot; As you gain experience and become more familiar with syntax, the specificity of your searches will improve. </p>

<h2>Tinker with It</h2>

<p>It&#39;s <em>unlikely</em> you&#39;re ever going to find an &quot;out of the box&quot; solution for <em>your</em> problem. So, you&#39;re probably going to have to finesse a similar solution you find online. This could be as simple as changing variables or as complicated as refactoring an entire method. Here are <strong>three tips</strong> to keep in mind when you start to tinker with a <em>possible</em> solution you come across . . .</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep track of what you&#39;ve tried so you’re not repeating the same thing over and over again.</li>
<li> Don’t be afraid to try new stuff! That&#39;s what&#39;s so awesome about coding . . . you can just use backspace if it doesn&#39;t work!</li>
<li>Keep your &quot;master branch&quot; isolated. Create a new branch or just have an &quot;experiment&quot; file open in your text editor to try out new stuff.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try Again</h2>

<p>If a solution you have found doesn&#39;t work, take a look again and target similar Stack Overflow posts. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is an awesome resource, but it can be a bit of a black hole if you&#39;re not careful. It&#39;s very easy to waste tons of time trying to track down a solution. Keep in mind, the solutions on Stack Overflow are for very specific questions begin asked. This could be a <em>good</em> or a <em>bad</em> thing! Oftentimes, you&#39;ll have to heavily refactor an answer. Regardless if the solution you find is similar or not, don&#39;t copy and paste it directly into your code. First, it&#39;s almost never going to work, and secondly, you&#39;re not going to learn <em>why</em> it works. Lastly, for the post to help, you <em>must</em> read both the question and answer in its <strong>entirety</strong>. It&#39;s going to be tempting to scroll down to that green checkmark, but DON&#39;T DO IT! </p>

<h2>Trash It</h2>

<p>The neat thing about coding is there are so many different ways to do the same thing. If your approach just isn&#39;t working, trash it, and start over! Don&#39;t be so attached to your code that you can&#39;t throw it away and start over. By starting with a clean slate, you&#39;ll more than likely create a better solution for tackling your problem than with your first attempt. </p>

<h2>Find an Expert</h2>

<p>If you <em>must</em> do it the way you&#39;re doing it, seek out an expert to help you solve your problem. Get a mentor or maybe post a question on Stack Overflow. Just <em>don&#39;t</em> spend a crazy amount of time on the same problem. When you do get some expert assistance, don&#39;t copy and paste. Again, look through what you&#39;ve tried previously and <em>see where you went wrong</em>. Remember, coding is not a single destination; it&#39;s a journey!</p>

        Throwing In the Towel

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2014</span>

    <p>It&#39;s midnight, and I&#39;m <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_in_the_towel">throwing in the towel</a>. Every day at The Iron Yard is difficult, but today was just one of those days. I walked in to ATV around 6:30am. Since then, I have been outside only three times-a Starbucks run, to FaceTime my family, and to grab something to eat. Based on the homework assigned for tonight, I thought my day would be a relatively easy day. <strong>Nope</strong>. Things didn&#39;t go as expected pretty early on, and my &quot;easy&quot; day was anything but. Since I started to code, I have realized that everything isn&#39;t going to immediately make sense or work the first time I try. As a matter of fact, <em>very few things do</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Day</h2>

<p>When a boxer&#39;s manager &quot;throws in the towel&quot; on his behalf, he&#39;s not quitting on the sport. Just that particular match. There will be another opponent to face. Tomorrow will be a new day for me, another day to crack open the lid to my MacBook and <em>try even harder</em>. I&#39;ve come to realize The Iron Yard isn&#39;t just about completing a single task, though collectively those assignments are extremely important. Instead, it is a <em>continual pursuit towards bettering myself as a coder</em>. And just one assignment isn&#39;t going to accomplish that. I&#39;m not saying that to minimize the daily homework I have, but it&#39;s a good reminder that there will inevitably be days when things <em>just aren&#39;t going to fall into place</em>. There will be setbacks no matter if you are coding or crocheting. Just remember that <strong>tomorrow</strong> will be another opportunity to strive toward reaching your goal.</p>

    <div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">puts Hello World
</code></pre></div>
<p>Hi, my name is <a href="http://natewinn.com/colophon/">Nathan Winn</a>. You can call me Nate. This is my new home. Welcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve wanted to start a blog for a <em>very</em> long time. I&#39;ve owned this domain for years, but I&#39;ve made excuse after excuse to not get something started. You know, the typical ones. &quot;I don&#39;t have enough time,&quot; &quot;nobody is interested in what I have to say,&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m not talented enough to make the site look good.&quot; </p>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve been challenged by both <a href="/2014/04/08/how-to-win-the-internet/">John Saddington</a> and my good friend, <a href="http://jadlimcaco.com/blog/homeless-designers/">Jad Limcaco</a> to create an online presence. So, this past Friday, I determined I would get a blog up and running by <strong>today</strong>.</p>

<p>Though this is <em>technically</em> my first post, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s quite a bit of content already posted. I started writing posts in my text editor since I began my coding journey at <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a> knowing that one day, I would finally create a site to post them. <em>That day is today</em>!</p>

<p>This blog is rolling on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Here&#39;s why I chose Jekyll...</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-12-jekyll-logo.png" alt="Jekyll Logo"></img></p>

<h2>Fast Setup</h2>

<p>No, really. It is super fast to get up and running. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out this <a href="https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47">tutorial</a>. You can have it up and running in about 10 minutes without any tweaks to the configuration.</p>

<h2>Built on Ruby</h2>

<p>Jekyll is not really a CMS, but a parsing engine bundled as a Ruby gem. It is a static site that is created by dynamic components. Jekyll is known as &quot;a simple, blog aware, static site generator.&quot; It is focused on blogging, but it has been used to create some pretty <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">epic sites</a> too. Since I&#39;m currently learning Rails having a &quot;blog&quot; built in Ruby is a perfect fit.</p>

<h2>Hosted on GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>After pushing your Jekyll site to GitHub, you can make it viewable on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Again, super easy and <strong>free</strong>! You heard right, free. Refer back to the previous <a href="https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47">tutorial</a> to see just how easy setup is. You can <em>even</em> redirect your site on GitHub Pages to your own URL simply by updating your DNS A Record and creating a CNAME file in the root directory that includes the name of the URL you&#39;re pointing to. Did I mention it&#39;s free?</p>

<h2>Text Editor + GitHub = Winning</h2>

<p>Jekyll allow me to write content just like I&#39;m coding. I&#39;m taking an immersive approach in learning to code so, &quot;blogging&quot; with Jekyll will become another way I can practice coding and GitHub. It really is a winn-winn. See what I did there?</p>

<p>I would love to hear what you think! Give me a shout out in the comments or reach out to me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/natewinn">@natewinn</a>.</p>
