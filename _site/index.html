Despite Blackberry&#39;s dominance in mobile phones, Apple chose to launch the iPhone late in the game. They igonored the doubters and set out to prove everyone wrong. What are you refusing to do because the odds are stacked against you? Ignore the doubters and start <em>today</em>. Who knows—you just <em>might</em> prove the critics <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aRelVKWbMAv0">wrong</a>.</p>

    <p>That&#39;s right. Mistakes are a <strong>good</strong> thing. They&#39;re mandatory for learning. You have to mess up to learn a new skill. I don&#39;t care who you are, <em>failure will be inevitable</em> when doing something for the first time.</p>

<h2>Even the Elite Fail</h2>

<p>I love watching the Olympics. It&#39;s fascinating when the TV network highlights an athlete to show a behind-the-scenes look into the incredible effort it took to compete among the world&#39;s elite. Often, you will see images of a 3-year-old falling down on skis for the first time or a skater practicing the same jump over and over and over again because it&#39;s not quite right. In other words, Olympic athletes shine on the world stage because they have failed time and time again.</p>

<h2>Fail, Learn, Repeat</h2>

<p>During <a href="http://bigdataweek.com/atlanta/">Big Data Week</a> a few weeks back, I attended a panel hosted at AKQA. The topic was <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Atlantas-Big-Data-Week-2014/events/176519662/?gj=rcs.j&amp;a=co2.j_grp&amp;rv=rcs.j">How to Become a Developer or Data Scientist</a>. Though the developers sitting on the panel had vastly different backgrounds, experience levels, and skill-sets, they had one common consensus . . . <em>write code</em>. Even if it&#39;s horrible, just start writing. And then write more code; throw it out; write some more, and then write even more.</p>

<p>The way you&#39;re going to become a developer is by being one. Don&#39;t be afraid to mess up! I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve laughed at the code I wrote when I first showed up to The Iron Yard. Frankly, it&#39;s horrible. But, that horrible code <em>taught me so much</em>. Forget copying and pasting. Start typing, mess stuff up, and figure out how to fix it. Failure will always be your best teacher.</p>

    <p>Screen sharing for computers isn’t something revolutionary. It&#39;s been around for years. Mac users will remember the days of iChat with AIM to enable video chat and screen sharing. But, you were limited to sharing with just fellow mac users — not to mention it was pretty temperamental, especially if you didn&#39;t have the right ports open on your router. Skype solved the cross-platform problem, but until recently you needed a premium account to access screen sharing. Even though screen sharing is available for all accounts, I find Skype&#39;s quality lacking and interface unnecessarily complicated. <em>But, fear not</em>! There’s a new tool that saves the day. </p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-17-screenhero-logo.png" alt="Screenhero Logo"></img></p>

<h2>It’s a bird, it’s a plane . . .</h2>

<p>For incredibly simple, yet incredibly awesome screen sharing look no further than <a href="http://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a>. Don&#39;t let the beta tag on the website scare you away. Though still in beta, Screenhero is <em>way</em> better than any screen sharing solution available. The folks over at Screenhero have labeled their product &quot;Google Docs for any application on your computer.&quot; <strong>And it&#39;s true</strong>! You can seamlessly collaborate with colleagues using any software on your computer. Getting started is as easy as downloading, installing, adding a contact, and clicking &quot;share&quot; in your menubar. </p>

<p>Screenhero has all the basics covered - bundled voice chat, cross platform support, great video and audio quality, and a minimalistic design. But, they have taken it a step further with <em>some amazing features</em>.</p>

<h2>Multiple mouse cursers</h2>

<p>Each user can <em>independently</em> control his own mouse curser on the screen. You can clearly see which curser belongs to each user with a convenient name label.</p>

<h2>Remote copy and paste</h2>

<p>Wanting to copy and paste while on sharing someone else&#39;s desktop? <strong>No problem</strong>! Using copy and paste will copy to your local clipboard. <em>It&#39;s like magic</em>! The awesome part is using copy function will not affect the clipboard of the person&#39;s screen you are on. </p>

<h2>Switch screens</h2>

<p>With just the click of a button, you can switch your screen and the screen of the user you are connected with. True collaboration! It&#39;s even more convenient than sitting next to the person you are working with because you can work on each other’s computer <em>at the same time</em>.</p>

<h2>Voice chat</h2>

<p>No need to share your screen to chat. Quickly voice chat without revealing your screen. Boasting crisp, 48kHz audio with echo cancellation, Screenhero is an easy way to connect with anyone on your contact list.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t quite realize how awesome Screenhero was until completing a group assignment just a few weeks ago. My partner and I completed much of a Sinatra app while working together remotely with Screenhero. We were both able to code the app on a single screen. <strong>Crazy right</strong>? We also switched back and forth between our desktops as we completed different parts of the app. </p>

<h2>But wait there&#39;s more!</h2>

<p>The possibilities are endless! And it&#39;s not just a great tool for collaboration, but for troubleshooting as well. It&#39;s the perfect app to help a family member with a nagging computer problem. No need to wait for Thanksgiving dinner to help Uncle Ed get his computer squared away. </p>

<p>Screenhero has become an <em>invaluable tool</em> among our cohort at The Iron Yard - to get emergency assistant from our instructor, Shelby, collaborate on group assignments, or lend each other a hand.</p>

<p>All this for the low, low price of . . . <strong>free</strong>. Go get it <a href="http://screenhero.com/download.html">now</a>.</p>
