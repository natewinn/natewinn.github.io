        Projects to Products
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>John spoke to us today about his latest creation <a href="http://pressgr.am/">Pressgram</a>, an iOS app that allows you to edit, filter, and publish photos to your own blog and site. It was a practical look into turning a <em>project</em> into a sellable <em>product</em>. The talk was <strong>epic</strong> with tons of practical advice from a proven entrepreneur. Here are my top takeaways . . .</p>

<h2>Innovative solutions are mashups of ineffective solutions</h2>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun! Innovators that are winning are able to take current ineffective solutions and mash them up to create a winning product. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complexity is easy to create, but simplicity is art.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Often times, innovative products are nothing more than <em>simplifications</em>. If you create systems to take complex problems and make them simplistic, you will be on the fast track to creating effective products.</p>

<h2>You don’t need complex tools to build stuff</h2>

<p>John demonstrated how he created his first mockups of Pressgram. He used <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/">Keynote</a>. Yes, that keynote. His goal was not to create a fancy mockup using the latest tools available, but to create a minimum viable product that could be <em>easily and effectively</em> communicated to others. Regardless, if the app is meant to function as a slide deck, John used a simple tool he was familiar with to get the job done. The goal is not to be enamored with the latest and greatest tools, but to focus on honing your product with the tools you have.</p>

<h2>Create emotional attachment by personalizing it</h2>

<p>At this point in our cohort, we&#39;re creating simplistic apps. But, we were challenged to constantly be thinking about how we can make our assigned projects, <em>our products</em>. The key in creating a winning product is having an emotional attachment to it, creating something that you <em>really</em> want. This is exactly what a start-up at Atlanta Tech Village did. Co-founders <a href="https://vergilis.co/stanley/">Stanley Vergilis</a> wanted a way to book tutoring students and <a href="https://vergilis.co/james/">James Loper</a> a better way to fix iPhone screens than his Craigslist post. So, they created <a href="https://vergilis.co/">Vergilis</a>. The key, they created something they <em>wanted</em>. Do this and passion will be inevitable.</p>

        Going Further, Faster

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>I think John summed it up well in his recent blog <a href="http://john.do/dream-big-dreams/">post</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But, perhaps, most importantly is that fact that this [cohort] model enables the individual to go further, faster. They can build momentum like there’s no tomorrow, and they realize that they were far more capable than they ever dared to hope and believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Up and Running</h2>

<p>We put this into practice today as we ventured into our first day of RubyOnRails. My fellow Rubyist and I realized that we could go <em>further</em>, <em>faster</em> by working together. And, we did! By collaborating, we were able to work together to get our first Ruby install up and running much faster than we would have on our own!</p>

        Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>In my past positions, when undertaking a project I gathered a team, sometimes volunteers and sometimes paid, and figured how we would get the job done. Being a part of a team has allowed me to see some <em>incredible</em> things accomplished. Without question, the &quot;task&quot; was <em>always</em> completed far better with the help of my team than I could have done myself. Though my experiences at The Iron Yard are largely a personal challenge, I realize that <strong>no man is an island unto himself</strong>. Here&#39;s &quot;my team&quot; that has already helped me immensely.</p>

<h2>Cheerleaders</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t care who you are, having a cheerleader that is pulling for you will push you to achieve more <em>than you ever thought possible</em>. My cheerleaders are my family. We heard (pun intended) a lot about <a href="http://nfl.si.com/2014/01/15/seattle-seahawks-centurylink-field-noise/">CenturyLink Field</a> this past football season—how the record-breaking decibel-level of fans helped the Seahawks win the Super Bowl. The fans had a part in the Seahawks success. When setting out to accomplish something new, there are times of discouragement, disbelief, and defeat. The Facetime chats from my wife and son, emails from my parents and in-laws, and texts from my extended family encourage me along the way. You need someone to believe in you and remind you that you <em>can do it</em>.</p>

<h2>A Veteran</h2>

<p>A mentor is an experienced or trusted advisor. Mine is <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/galanbridgman">Galan Bridgman</a>. We have been friends for years, and though he doesn&#39;t know Ruby or Rails specifically, he&#39;s been been coding for well over twenty years. He know&#39;s what it is like to learn code and, more importantly, to learn to <em>think like a programmer</em>. He has made himself available to offer practical advice that has been applicable to every programming language. He often looks at my code and offers suggestions of how to make things <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#x27;t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a>, fix typos, and reminds me of validations that I overlooked. Find an advisor who has been there, done that and can offer practical advice to overcome hurdles they too faced.</p>

<h2>A Coach</h2>

<p>Find someone who knows their stuff and can help you learn it. The leader of our cohort at The Iron Yard is <a href="http://shelbyswitzer.com/">Shelby Switzer</a>. Though I committed to attend The Iron Yard before I knew Shelby would be my teacher, I was excited to learn she would be the one teaching. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I am still pretty starstruck that I got <a href="https://twitter.com/switzerly">@switzerly</a> to teach Ruby at <a href="https://twitter.com/TheIronYard">@TheIronYard</a>. Lucky us and lucky students! She&#39;s a joy to work with.</p>&mdash; Mason Stewart (@masondesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/masondesu/statuses/455122730921508864">April 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Why? She&#39;s a self-taught Rubyist that has only been coding for a short time. She relates to us learning &quot;late.&quot; Because of this, she draws from her own experiences and knows how much we are capable of, pushing us accordingly. In addition, she taught English as a second-language to children in Nepal which is so important because programming is a language.</p>

<h2>Teammates</h2>

<p>Your &quot;teammates&quot; are those who have set out to accomplish the same exact thing as you. My teammates are those who are a part of the spring <a href="http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/">Rails cohort</a> at The Iron Yard. We are in it together, day in and day out. We learn together, work together, and laugh together (which is essential, <em>trust me</em>). We all live on HipChat, where we can send out a call for help or post some memes for comic relief. There are times when you can lift up a fellow teammate teammates and others are accessible to help you understand what they too struggled with. </p>

<p>No matter what you set out to accomplish, there is always value in building a team that, in turn, can help build you up. Setting out to achieve something great? <em>Build a great team</em>.</p>

        Making a List, Checking It Twice
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>In 2007, Atul Gawande, general surgeon at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote an article for the New Yorker entitled <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all">The Checklist</a>. This article later developed into a New York Times Bestseller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000">The Checklist Manifesto</a>. The book’s main point is simple: no matter how expert you may be, well-designed checklists can improve outcomes. In fact, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">Jack Dorsey</a>, co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square, gives a copy of this <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Jack-Dorsey-Gives-Everyone-He-Hires-The-Same-Red-3909392.php">book</a> to everyone hired at Square.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-04-14-checklist-manifesto.png" alt="Square Welcome Packet"></img>
<figure><figcaption>Box Given to New Hires at Square</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>I read the book several years ago but was reminded of it as we dug into Sinatra this week. <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a Ruby framework similar to RubyOnRails, but more lightweight. To be quite honest, I did <em>horribly</em> on the assignment the first day we covered into Sinatra. I struggled to keep up in class which made the assignment tremendously difficult to complete. In fact, I didn&#39;t finish it. Our assignment was to create a web app that met the following requirements . . .</p>

<ol>
<li>List of favorite things</li>
<li>Be able to match input against certain criteria </li>
<li>Create at 3 pages (error page, index page, and form)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Checklist . . . Check</h2>

<p>Day two of Sinatra, I created a checklist. A simple list that outlined every step I needed to take to get a basic Sinatra <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> app up and running. The checklist helped me immensely! With as fast as we are moving, I realized there is no possible way I&#39;m going to remember every step. If a world-class surgeon can rely on a checklist to ensure his procedure goes according to plan, I&#39;m pretty sure a newbie coder could use one too. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re learning a new skill or technique, I would encourage you to create a checklist to act as a guide. Practice doesn&#39;t make perfect; practice makes permanent. Don&#39;t view a checklist as a crutch, especially when you&#39;re first starting out. View it as a tool to ensure you are learning a new skill correctly.</p>

        One Year's Time

    <span class="post-date">09 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Exactly one year ago today, I created an account at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">Dev Bootcamp</a> and began filling out an application in hopes of joining an upcoming cohort. But that very same night, I began to reason with myself why I would never be able to attend.</p>

<h2>Excuses, Excuses</h2>

<p>Of course, I had plenty of excuses. In just three months, my wife and I were expecting our first child, I had no where near the money I needed for entry, and then there was the small detail of supporting my family without any income for three months! My aspirations of attending a coding bootcamp became a distant memory. I was twenty-nine years-old and accepted the fact that my time to do work that truly excited me had past. I came to accept it.</p>

<p>Shortly after the first of the year, I was casually browsing through Twitter and noticed <a href="http://john.do/">John Saddington</a>, whom I have been following for years, mention <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a>.</p>

<p>I quickly googled “The Iron Yard,” and my curiosity was instantly peaked. I immediately emailed John, and it just so happened that he was going to be in San Francisco (only a 30 minute drive from my home) the very next day to speak at a conference. </p>

<h2>My Year</h2>

<p>While grabbing sushi together that next evening, John told me just a handful of the amazing stories of people in my similar situation that had attended The Iron Yard. In just a 3-month period of time, people were completely changing the course of their lives. Just before I hopped into my car to drive home from the city that evening, John tweeted this...</p>

<p><img><p align="center"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Make this the year. Don’t let it go to waste.</p>&mdash; John Saddington (@saddington) <a href="https://twitter.com/saddington/statuses/428403179722506240">January 29, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></img>
<p></p>

<p>That night, I decided this was going to be my year! Today, exactly one year from the day I registered at Dev Bootcamp, I’m writing this post from inside <a href="http://atlantatechvillage.com/">Atlanta Tech Village</a>. Though only one week into the Rails dev cohort, I’ve already been challenged, stretched, and pushed more in this short period than I ever have in my entire life!</p>
