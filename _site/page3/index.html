        Throwing In the Towel
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2014</span>

    <p>It&#39;s midnight, and I&#39;m <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_in_the_towel">throwing in the towel</a>. Every day at The Iron Yard is difficult, but today was just one of those days. I walked in to ATV around 6:30am. Since then, I have been outside only three times-a Starbucks run, to FaceTime my family, and to grab something to eat. Based on the homework assigned for tonight, I thought my day would be a relatively easy day. <strong>Nope</strong>. Things didn&#39;t go as expected pretty early on, and my &quot;easy&quot; day was anything but. Since I started to code, I have realized that everything isn&#39;t going to immediately make sense or work the first time I try. As a matter of fact, <em>very few things do</em>.</p>

<h2>A New Day</h2>

<p>When a boxer&#39;s manager &quot;throws in the towel&quot; on his behalf, he&#39;s not quitting on the sport. Just that particular match. There will be another opponent to face. Tomorrow will be a new day for me, another day to crack open the lid to my MacBook and <em>try even harder</em>. I&#39;ve come to realize The Iron Yard isn&#39;t just about completing a single task, though collectively those assignments are extremely important. Instead, it is a <em>continual pursuit towards bettering myself as a coder</em>. And just one assignment isn&#39;t going to accomplish that. I&#39;m not saying that to minimize the daily homework I have, but it&#39;s a good reminder that there will inevitably be days when things <em>just aren&#39;t going to fall into place</em>. There will be setbacks no matter if you are coding or crocheting. Just remember that <strong>tomorrow</strong> will be another opportunity to strive toward reaching your goal.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is <a href="http://natewinn.com/colophon/">Nathan Winn</a>. You can call me Nate. This is my new home. Welcome.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve wanted to start a blog for a <em>very</em> long time. I&#39;ve owned this domain for years, but I&#39;ve made excuse after excuse to not get something started. You know, the typical ones. &quot;I don&#39;t have enough time,&quot; &quot;nobody is interested in what I have to say,&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m not talented enough to make the site look good.&quot; </p>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve been challenged by both <a href="/how-to-win-the-internet.html">John Saddington</a> and my good friend, <a href="http://jadlimcaco.com/blog/homeless-designers/">Jad Limcaco</a> to create an online presence. So, this past Friday, I determined I would get a blog up and running by <strong>today</strong>.</p>

<p>Though this is <em>technically</em> my first post, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll notice there&#39;s quite a bit of content already posted. I started writing posts in my text editor since I began my coding journey at <a href="http://theironyard.com/">The Iron Yard</a> knowing that one day, I would finally create a site to post them. <em>That day is today</em>!</p>

<p>This blog is rolling on <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Here&#39;s why I chose Jekyll...</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-12-jekyll-logo.png" alt="Jekyll Logo"></img></p>

<h2>Fast Setup</h2>

<p>No, really. It is super fast to get up and running. If you don&#39;t believe me, check out this <a href="https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47">tutorial</a>. You can have it up and running in about 10 minutes without any tweaks to the configuration.</p>

<h2>Built on Ruby</h2>

<p>Jekyll is not really a CMS, but a parsing engine bundled as a Ruby gem. It is a static site that is created by dynamic components. Jekyll is known as &quot;a simple, blog aware, static site generator.&quot; It is focused on blogging, but it has been used to create some pretty <a href="http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/">epic sites</a> too. Since I&#39;m currently learning Rails having a &quot;blog&quot; built in Ruby is a perfect fit.</p>

<h2>Hosted on GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>After pushing your Jekyll site to GitHub, you can make it viewable on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Again, super easy and <strong>free</strong>! You heard right, free. Refer back to the previous <a href="https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47">tutorial</a> to see just how easy setup is. You can <em>even</em> redirect your site on GitHub Pages to your own URL simply by updating your DNS A Record and creating a CNAME file in the root directory that includes the name of the URL you&#39;re pointing to. Did I mention it&#39;s free?</p>

<h2>Text Editor + GitHub = Winning</h2>

<p>Jekyll allow me to write content just like I&#39;m coding. I&#39;m taking an immersive approach in learning to code so, &quot;blogging&quot; with Jekyll will become another way I can practice coding and GitHub. It really is a winn-winn. See what I did there?</p>

<p>I would love to hear what you think! Give me a shout out in the comments or reach out to me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/natewinn">@natewinn</a>.</p>

        Halftime
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 May 2014</span>

    <p>My son, Owen, will be 9 months old tomorrow. It&#39;s <em>incredible</em> how fast the time has gone by! On days like this, I like to look through the pictures my wife and I have taken of him and take just a few moments to reminisce.</p>

<p>Without fail, I say to my wife, “I can’t believe how much he has grown!” In fact, I <em>always</em> remind her of the picture I took when she put him in his carseat for the the very first time. His newborn clothes were so big on him, and he nearly disappeared into his carseat.</p>

<h2>Overlooking Progress</h2>

<p>It’s so apparent by looking back to his first few days of life to see how much he has grown. He now sleeps through the night, crawls, interacts with us, and climbs on things (Yes, he climbed up there all by himself in that picture below!). My son’s growth or “progress” is so easy to overlook on a daily basis. My progress at The Iron Yard is no different.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-10-owen-on-nightstand.jpg" alt="Owen on the Nightstand"></img>
<figure><figcaption>Owen perched on his favorite spot</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The daily grind is incredibly taxing, and it seems that our cohort is making slow progress. But, when you take a step back and look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926">first gist</a> we posted on GitHub, you can begin to see it. Real progress! Don’t get me wrong, in the world of RubyOnRails I’m still an infant crawling around on the floor. But I’m definitely not a newborn any longer.</p>

<p>Six weeks ago today, I boarded an airplane to leave my family, knowing next to nothing about code. Yesterday, I pushed a web app to a <a href="https://github.com/natewinn/remember">GitHub Repo</a> where users can upload photos and add tags or comments. And, no, I didn’t have an idea what a “GitHub Repo” was 6 weeks ago. Looking back, today, at “half-time,” it&#39;s pretty cool to see how far we have come.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>When setting out to achieve a goal, no matter how big or small, take a step back on milestone days and recall the progress you&#39;ve made—<em>not to pat yourself on the back</em> for the steps that you’ve made, but to <em>motivate you to accomplish even more</em> in the days ahead.</p>

        A Common Goal
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 May 2014</span>

    <p>Having someone with which to strive toward a common goal will exponentially increase your chances of success. This is exactly why the <a href="http://john.do/dream-big-dreams/">cohort model</a> at The Iron Yard is so awesome. When sailing out into unchartered territory and attempting to achieve something big, it is <em>vital</em> to have someone you can be accountable to—someone who is able to celebrate each success, yet encourage with every setback. </p>

<h2>An Equal Challenge</h2>

<p>When my wife and I finally decided I would attend The Iron Yard, she also wanted to challenge herself. She knew I was facing the most difficult challenges of my life so; she also wanted conquer something equally as challenging—run a marathon. As we have both had our ups and downs in striving to reach our goals, we are able to <em>keep each other motivated</em> to stay on track to reach our respective goals.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-03-before-running-marathon.jpg" alt="Nate and Jo Before the Race"></img>
<figure><figcaption>Before the Big Race</figcaption></figure></p>

<h2>Motivated By Others</h2>

<p>This weekend, I was able to fly across the country for just a day and a half to see my wife complete the <a href="http://www.brazenracing.com/westernpacific.html">Western Pacific Marathon</a>. It was incredibly motivating to see her cross that finish line. I keep a picture of her wearing the finisher&#39;s medal on my desktop and often look at it during the day. It motivates me to press forward becuase I so often get discouraged.</p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-03-after-run.jpg" alt="Winn Family After the Race"></img>
<figure><figcaption>After Crossing the Finish Line</figcaption></figure> </p>

<p>There have been <em>numerous</em> times along the way that I&#39;ve really wanted to throw in the towel. It says <strong>intensive</strong> on The Iron Yard website for good reason! But, I try to remember the <a href="/teamwork-makes-the-dream-work.html">people</a> pulling for me, and I don&#39;t want to let them down. I would encourage you in setting out to achieve something big, take someone along for the ride.</p>

        The Rubber Duck
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2014</span>

    <p>Today, <a href="http://timw.co/">Tim Whitacre</a> of <a href="http://argyllstudios.com/">Argyll Studios</a> joined us at The Iron Yard to discuss his experiences as a front-end developer. During his talk, he mentioned <em>duck programming</em>, a reference to a story in the book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>. </p>

<p><img><img src="/assets/2014-05-01-rubber-duck.jpg" alt="Rubber Duck"></img></p>

<h2>Line-by-line</h2>

<p>Duck programming is debugging by explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck. In other words, describing what the code is <em>supposed to do</em> and then <em>observing what it actually does</em>. Tim said that duck programming has enabled him to solve countless problems he has encountered over the years. When stumped, he challenged us to answer the following questions about our code: </p>

<ol>
<li>What is your code actually doing?</li>
<li>What do you expect your code to do?</li>
<li>What resources have you looked into to fix the problem?</li>
</ol>

<p>His advice has already proven to be a help to me. When I&#39;m unable to get past a problem in my code, I step back, go for a walk around the block, and <em>try</em> to go through my code systematically. It doesn&#39;t always work, but there have been times I&#39;ve fixed minor problems realatively quickly.</p>
