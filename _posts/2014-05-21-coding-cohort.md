"What does what mean?"

"Cohort....you said you're going to be a part of a "cohort" at The Iron Yard. I'm just curious what that means?"

This was a pretty typical response I heard when telling friends and family of my plans of attending a coding bootcamp. I honestly couldn't give a good response to those who asked me about the term "cohort". Now nearing the two month mark at The Iron Yard in Atlanta, I *now* understand why the word "cohort" is far more than a cliche.

## United in Battle
The word [cohort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_Roman_military_unit) comes from the latin *cohors* referring to a tactical unit in the Roman army during the first and second centuries. The 480 men making up a "cohort" were organized and commanded by one ranking official. They were inseparable. United both in life and battle. Everything was approached *together*. It should then come as no surprise why the organizational structure of the Roman military is still regarded as a model for modern militaries. The success stems *directly* from the success of the cohort model.

And that is why "cohort" is the only fitting term for my fellow coders and I. Over the past 8 weeks, we have done far more than sit in the same classroom. We have become family pressing toward a common goal, striving to reach an elusive prizeâ€”not individually racing to be the first to cross the finish line, but rather choosing to endure the marathon together. Finishing would *not be possible* without having fellow comrades facing the same battle.
