37 Signals, now simply known as [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), has some pretty incrdible stories of the great lengths potential candidates have gone to stand out from other applicants. They have hired based on unbelievable [open sources contributions](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2068-pratik-naik-joins-37signals), creating [job application sites](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/2709-sites-that-landed-jobs-at-37signals), and even jumping through [some crazy hoops](http://signalvnoise.com/posts/1726-the-newest-signal-jason-zimdars-designer) during the interview process.
