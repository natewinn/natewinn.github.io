John spoke to us today about  [Pressgram](http://pressgr.am/), an iOS app that allows you to edit, filter, and publish photos to your own WordPress blog and site. It was a practical look into turning a *project* into a sellable *product*. The talk was full of practical advice from an entrepreneur. Here are my top takeaways . . .

## Innovative solutions are mashups of ineffective solutions
There is nothing new under the sun! Innovators that are winning are able to take current ineffective solutions and mash them up to create a winning product. 

>Complexity is easy to create, but simplicity is art.

Often times, innovative products are nothing more than *simplifications*. If you create systems to take complex problems and make them simplistic, you will be on the fast track to creating effective products.

##You donâ€™t need complex tools to build stuff
John demonstrated how he created his first mockups of Pressgram. He used [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/mac/keynote/). Yes, that keynote. His goal was not to create a fancy mockup using the latest tools available, but to create a minimum viable product that could be *easily and effectively* communicated to others. Regardless, if the app is meant to function as a slide deck, John used a simple tool he was familiar with to get the job done. The goal is not to be enamored with the latest and greatest tools, but to focus on honing your product with the tools you have.

##Create emotional attachment by personalizing it
At this point in our cohort, we're creating simplistic apps. But, we were challenged to constantly be thinking about how we can make our assigned projects, *our products*. The key in creating a winning product is having an emotional attachment to it, creating something that you *really* want. This is exactly what a start-up at Atlanta Tech Village did. Co-founders [Stanley Vergilis](https://vergilis.co/stanley/) wanted a way to book tutoring students and [James Loper](https://vergilis.co/james/) a better way to fix iPhone screens than his Craigslist post. So, they created [Vergilis](https://vergilis.co/). The key, they created something they *wanted*. Do this and passion will be inevitable.
