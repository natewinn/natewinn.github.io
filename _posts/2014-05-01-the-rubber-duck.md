Today, [Tim Whitacre](http://timw.co/) of [Argyll Studios](http://argyllstudios.com/) joined us at The Iron Yard to discuss his experiences as a front-end developer. During his talk, he mentioned *duck programming*, a reference to a story in the book, [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X).

Duck programming is debugging by explaining your code line-by-line to a rubber duck. In other words, describing what the code is *supposed to do* and then *observing what it actually does*. Tim said that duck programming has enabled him to solve countless problems he has encountered over the years. When stumped, he challenged us to answer the following questions about our code: 

1. What is your code actually doing?
2. What do you expect your code to do?
3. What resources have you looked into to fix the problem?

His advice has already proven to be a help to me. When I'm unable to get past a problem in my code, I step back, go for a walk around the block, and *try* to go through my code systematically. It doesn't always work, but there have been times I've fixed minor problems realatively quickly.
