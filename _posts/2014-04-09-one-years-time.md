Exactly one year ago today, I created an account at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) and began filling out an application in hopes of joining an upcoming cohort. But that very same night, I began to reason with myself why I would never be able to attend.

## Excuses, Excuses
Of course, I had plenty of excuses. In just three months, my wife and I were expecting our first child, I had no where near the money I needed for entry, and then there was the small detail of supporting my family without any income for three months! My aspirations of attending a coding bootcamp became a distant memory. I was twenty-nine years-old and accepted the fact that my time to do work that truly excited me had past. I came to accept it.

Shortly after the first of the year, I was casually browsing through Twitter and noticed [John Saddington](http://john.do/), whom I have been following for years, mention [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/).

I quickly googled “The Iron Yard,” and my curiosity was instantly peaked. I immediately emailed John, and it just so happened that he was going to be in San Francisco (only a 30 minute drive from my home) the very next day to speak at a conference. 

While grabbing sushi together that next evening, John told me just a handful of the amazing stories of people in my similar situation that had attended The Iron Yard. In just a 3-month period of time, people were completely changing the course of their lives. Just before I hopped into my car to drive home from the city that evening, John tweeted this...

## My Year
That night, I decided this was going to be my year! Today, exactly one year from the day I registered at Dev Bootcamp, I’m writing this post from inside [Atlanta Tech Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/). Though only one week into the Rails dev cohort, I’ve already been challenged, stretched, and pushed more in this short period than I ever have in my entire life!
