This Wednesday we dove head first into HTML and CSS with our Teaching Assistant, Katy. Working as a designer in the past, I've mocked up quite a few website to be coded. Though I've learned best practices to pass off mockups to a developer, I regretably never took the time to learn how to properly code the designs myself. 

On Wednesday, we were challenged to code an intricate <a href="http://natewinn.github.io/public/assets/2014-04-13-pixel-for-pixel.png" target="_blank">mockup</a>. A similar design to what I may have designed in the past. Our cohort was challenged to replicated the site *pixel for pixel* using HTML and CSS. By the end of the first day, I was able to wrap my head around the syntax and grid system. From there, I was off to the races...

## Learn and Apply
Though parts were painfully slow and frustrating. I was kicking myself the entire time for not forcing myself to learn this sooner! The challenge had always been daunting, too difficult to begin. But here, you are expected to make things happenâ€”to learn and apply the skills *very quickly*.

I've always had a critical eye regarding design, especially my own. Tirelessly working with developers to ensure the final layout would match what I created in Photoshop. It has definitely been a challenge to be on the other side of the table. Spending hours adjusting seemingly insignificant objects to ensure the final design was pixel for pixel definitely gave me *a new appreciation for coding*.
