Dan Cornnell is the *fourth* interview from the members of [The Iron Yard - Atlanta Rails](http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/) cohort.

## What were you up to before coming to The Iron Yard?
I worked at the Georgia World Congress Convention Center in downtown Atlanta, but it was more of an event-to-event basis. They would call me up and let me know a convention was coming up to see if I wanted to work. I was usually available, so I did that. It was part time, but I did it as much as I could. I'm originally from Tampa, Florida, but I have lived up here in Atlanta for about five years now. So, I didn't have to relocate to come to The Iron Yard. 

## Why did you choose The Iron Yard?
Honestly, one of my main reasons for coming here was that *I really like the Atlanta area*. I had been looking at similar programs around the US. I applied to a couple of them, but this was the first one to respond. It didn't hurt that it was right outside my back door. I really wasn't opposed to relocating because I knew that attending a coding bootcamp was something that I really wanted to do. Though I was willing to go somewhere else for it, I'm glad The Iron Yard was a perfect fit. 

I had been looking at a bunch of different programs, similar to The Iron Yard, in the last year or two. I even considered going back to school to get my masters degree, but I really didn't see myself going back to a traditional, slow-paced university environment. *I was ready to learn something new and begin putting it into practice right away*. I have a four-year degree in advertising, and I would say that though I learned a lot, it wasn't very focused. At [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/), I know I'm going to learn Rails, an incredibly practical skill that I know I can use. It's not just general knowledge about computer programming. Though I like advertising, it was just way too broad of a degree for me. I was definitely looking for something more specific.

## Why Ruby on Rails?
I've done computer stuff like HTML and CSS before. I also took a few computer programming classes in college. For some reason, I had to take a "foreign language" to fulfill the requirements for my degree. Learning an actual foreign language didn't really interest me, but I had the option to take a computer programming class instead. So, I took an HTML and CSS class and an intro to computer programming class. It wasn't anything too specific, but I did enjoy the problem solving aspect of it. I can remember always enjoying those classes. When I began looking for another job, sifting through job postings online, *Rails positions were always popping up*. I feel like it's definitely a good skill to learn, and it seems to definitely be something that I would enjoy.

## Expectations vs. actual experience?
I feel like they do a very good job of telling you that it's going to be *a lot of work*. I feel like I am picking it up pretty well. I have a lot of work to do, but it's never anything too confusing or too hard. Though we cover a lot of material, everything seems to be essential. The work is interesting; it's all stuff that I want to learn, so it really doesn't seem like work to me. I find myself thinking about problems that I run into in my coding even when I'm not working. **It's fun**. Don't get me wrong, there are times when it's confusing and hard, and I'd rather not be doing it, but it's never anything too crazy. I also really like the [ATV](http://atlantatechvillage.com/) building. Sometimes it can be hard to focus around here because of the ping pong and free beer. But, it's cool that there's always stuff going on. I feel like that is an important aspect as well. Though, I do wish I had a little bit more free time so I could go to meet ups and stuff like that because I'm usually just way too busy to do other stuff.

## What do you enjoy most about The Iron Yard?
*I like learning things that I feel are actually useful*. I'm learning a lot of quality stuff even outside the classroom setting too. I feel like just talking to [John](http://john.do/about/), [Shelby](https://twitter.com/switzerly), and the other people in the cohort is always helpful. I really like everyone here. It's evident that everyone wants to learn as much as possible in the time we are here. So, we definitely help each other out. *I like that a lot*. 

## Your experience before coming to The Iron Yard?
I graduated from college in 2008, and the last two years, I was really into advertising classes. So, I took a class about Dreamweaver stuff. It was all front-end design. I took a PHP class at a local community college too. But, the instructor moved way too slow. It was a summer course that was 50% online and 50% in the classroom. Honestly, it was a joke, and I didn't learn a thing.

I've messed around with computer stuff in the past, but never anything too serious. Before, starting at The Iron Yard, I was trying to get into grad school. I took a prep course that finished a week before I started here. So, I hadn't really even looked at any Ruby stuff other than what [John Saddington](http://john.do/) mentioned to me and typical [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) stuff. It was kind of helpful. What helped me to prepare the most was following John's suggestion. He called me up on a Friday and said if I was really serious about [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/), I should complete Codecademy's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby tracks by Sunday to see if it was something I still wanted to do. It was a ton of stuff to do in three days. What I didn't know at the time was that it was really similar to what we have here every day. But, it was all stuff I found interesting. I really enjoyed doing it. On Sunday when I called him back, *I told him it was great and that I was ready for more*.

## Best advice for those considering a coding bootcamp?
Clear your schedule as much as possible. You're going to be incredibly busy. I still have free time to to do stuff I want, but I definitely feel like I am going full speed ahead **all of the time**. It's difficult to catch a moment to step back and take breath, but I feel like I am picking it up pretty well. I am not too worried about it. I couldn't imagine trying to be a part of a coding bootcamp and have a job at the same time. I don't think it would be possible. I would really advise devoting as much time as possible to it and give it your 100% undivided attention.
