title: Throwing In the Towel

It's midnight, and I'm [throwing in the towel](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throw_in_the_towel). Every day at The Iron Yard is difficult, but today was just one of those days. I walked in to ATV around 6:30am. Since then, I have been outside only three times-a Starbucks run, to FaceTime my family, and to grab something to eat. Based on the homework assigned for tonight, I thought my day would be a relatively easy day. **Nope**. Things didn't go as expected pretty early on, and my "easy" day was anything but. Since I started to code, I have realized that everything isn't going to immediately make sense or work the first time I try. As a matter of fact, *very few things do*.

## A New Day
When a boxer's manager "throws in the towel" on his behalf, he's not quitting on the sport. Just that particular match. There will be another opponent to face. Tomorrow will be a new day for me, another day to crack open the lid to my MacBook and *try even harder*. I've come to realize The Iron Yard isn't just about completing a single task, though collectively those assignments are extremely important. Instead, it is a *continual pursuit towards bettering myself as a coder*. And just one assignment isn't going to accomplish that. I'm not saying that to minimize the daily homework I have, but it's a good reminder that there will inevitably be days when things *just aren't going to fall into place*. There will be setbacks no matter if you are coding or crocheting. Just remember that **tomorrow** will be another opportunity to strive toward reaching your goal.
