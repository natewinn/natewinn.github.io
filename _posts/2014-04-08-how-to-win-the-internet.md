Today, [John Saddington](https://twitter.com/saddington) stopped by to chat with the Ruby and iOS cohorts about *Winning the Internet*. His challenge to us was simple. **Be in control of your brand online**. Each of us have the power to curate what people find when "Googling" our name. 

##Still Learning
Because competition has become so fierce in the marketplace, you must show others why you are different, what sets you a part from the pack. The goal is not to show others that you are an expert, but to show others *your constant pursuit in becoming an expert*. This is precisely the reason I entitled this blog, "Still Learning." The more I learn, the more I realize how much more I have to learn.

>There are people that do and there are people that dream.

To *Win the Internet*, John challenged us with four practical thoughts about how we can make ourselves stand out in a crowd.

##Capture a thought and tell others.
Take one specific thing and show people that you understand it. Then, take that **a step further**. Prove you are able to take what you've learned and help others understand it. It is easy to comprehend a topic for yourself, but to be able to transfer that knowledge in a *clear, relatable message* to someone else is invaluable.

##Donâ€™t be afraid to be unique.
Being unique is what sets you apart from the pack. Having an opinion and telling others how you really feel is important! Apple has become an industry leader with [Think Different](http://www.thecrazyones.it/spot-en.html). Their entire company culture is built around challenging the status quo. Companies are looking for people who *care*, and having an opinion proves you are passionate about whatever you undertake.

##Talk about how your are improving.
Show others that you are a *lifelong learner*. When put in the proper perspective, every experience has the opportunity to be a teachable moment. This shows others that you are not interested in just existing, but consistently striving to improve yourself and others around you. 

>Everyone that you meet knows something you don't.

No one likes working with a know it all! And by telling others what you are attempting to learn, you prove to others you *have not arrived*.

##Prove you can be an ambassador
Effective communication is arguably the most valued asset to a company. By having a message online, you are effectively an ambassador for yourself. By communicating the value of your own personal brand, you are proving *ahead of time* that you can transfer that to whatever company you work for.

I was challenged to tailor the images and content that returned when people search for me online. I want people to be wowed when googling "Nate Winn." How are you winning the internet?
