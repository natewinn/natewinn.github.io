title: The Language of the Future

Though I'm 30-years-old and just now diving into coding, I realize there is no better time to learn than **now**. It's never *too late* to start learning. The landscape is changing so fast that *everyone* has to be continually learning the latest technologies. So, there's always a good spot to jump in. Don't let a late start discourage you from getting started! There's no better day than **today** to start learning.

Starbucks is my usual Sunday morning spot. I get there early to work on my weekend homework. This past Sunday, the New York Times caught my eye on the way in. This was on the front page:

It's cool to see kids getting excited about code and problem solving at such a young age. Many parents and educators are realizing that programming is the language of the future and kids better start learning **now**. The [NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/us/reading-writing-arithmetic-and-lately-coding.html?_r=0) goes on tell just how popular coding programs for kids are becoming. Kids are ditching video games for programs like [Turtle Academy](http://turtleacademy.com/) and [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/). "Parents love the idea of giving children something to do with computers that they see as productive."

## The Next Generation 
Though still just a beginner, I'm looking forward to teaching at [The Iron Yard Kids Academy](http://theironyard.com/academy/scratch/) on May 29. It's going to be fun to spark an interest in future programmers. 

If you're looking for a place to get started with code, for both kids and adults, you'll find an awesome list of resources [here](https://medium.com/global-silicon-valley/a2dc04ea9529). Jump in and get started today!
