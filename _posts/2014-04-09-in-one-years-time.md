Exactly one year ago today, I created an account at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/) and began to fill out an applicaiton in hopes to join an upcoming cohort. But, that very same night, I began to reason to myself why I would never be able to attend. 

## Excuses, Excuses
Of course, I had *plenty of excuses*. In just three months, my wife and I were expecting our first child, I had no where near the money I needed for entry, and then there was the small detail of supporting my family without any income for three months! My aspirations of attending a coding bootcamp became a distant memory. I was twenty-nine years-old and accepted the fact that my time to do work that truly excited me had past. I came to accept it.

Shortly after the first of the year, I was casually browsing through Twitter and noticed [John Saddington](http://john.do/), whom I have been following for years, mention [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/).

I quickly googled "The Iron Yard"  and my curiousity was instantly peaked. I immediately emailed John, and it just so happened that he was going to be in San Francisco the very next day to speak at a conference. 

## My Year
While grabbing sushi that very next evening, John told me just a handful of the amazing stories of people in similar situations that had attended The Iron Yard. In just a 3-month period of time, people were completely changing the course of their life. Just before I hopped into my car to drive home from the city that evening, John tweeted this . . .

That night, I decided this *was going to be my year*! Last Sunday, I moved sight unseen across the country from the Silicon Valley to Atlanta to become a coder. Today, exactly one year from the day I registered at Dev Bootcamp, I'm writing this post from inside [Atlanta Tech Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), the amazing facility where The Iron Yard - Atlanta is located. Though only one-week into the Rails dev cohort, I've already been challenged, stretched, and pushed more in this short period than I ever have in my entire life. It has been an amazing ride so far and I can't wait to see what lies in store.
