When venturing out to accomplish something new there is always an equal amount of **excitement** and **fear**. And that's exactly the feeling I have as I sit here on Southwest Flight #WN564.

Just a few hours ago, I left everything familiar to meâ€”my family, home, and job to travel *sight unseen* to Atlanta, Georgia to attend [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/). As I fly across the country, I can't help but contemplate what lies in store for the next 12 weeks. I'm genuinely looking forward to blogging about my journey to becoming a coder. 

##A Helping Hand
My decision to attend a coding bootcamp was heavily influenced by others who have already taken the leap of faith to attend a bootcamp, especially, [Daniel Donaldson](http://www.colorturtle.com/). Daniel went out of his way to transparently answer practical questions I had. Just by him blogging about his experiences and the obstacles he overcame to attend, I was *challenged to do the same*. Hopefully, my experiences will be a challenge and motivation to others who are struggling with the same decision I faced.
