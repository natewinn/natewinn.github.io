title: Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
comments: true
---

In my past positions, when undertaking a project I gathered a team, sometimes volunteers and sometimes paid, and figured how we would get the job done. Being a part of a team has allowed me to see some *incredible* things accomplished. Without question, the "task" was *always* completed far better with the help of my team than I could have done myself. Though my experiences at The Iron Yard are largely a personal challenge, I realize that no man is an island unto himself. Here's my team that has already helped me immensely.

## Cheerleaders
I don't care who you are, having a cheerleader that is pulling for you will push you to achieve more *than you ever thought possible*. My cheerleaders are my family. We heard (pun intended) a lot about [CenturyLink Field] (http://nfl.si.com/2014/01/15/seattle-seahawks-centurylink-field-noise/) this past football seasonâ€”how the record-breaking decibel-level of fans helped the Seahawks win the Super Bowl. Especially when setting out to accomplish something new, there are times of discouragement, disbelief, and defeat. The Facetime chats from my wife and son, emails from my parents and in-laws, and texts from my extended family encourage me along the way. You need someone to believe in you and remind you that you *can do it*.

## A Veteran
A mentor is an experienced or trusted advisor. Mine is [Galan Bridgman](http://www.linkedin.com/in/galanbridgman). We have been friends for years, and though he doesn't know Ruby or Rails, he's been been coding for well over twenty years. He know's what it is like to learn code and, more importantly, to learn to *think like a programmer*. He has made himself available to offer practical advice that has been applicable to every programming language. He often looks at my code and offers suggestions of how to make things [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself), fix typos, and reminds me of validations that I overlooked. Find an advisor who has been there, done that and can offer practical advice to overcome hurdles they too faced.

## A Coach
Find someone who knows their stuff and can help you learn it. The leader of our cohort at The Iron Yard is [Shelby Switzer](http://shelbyswitzer.com/). Though I committed to attend The Iron Yard before I knew Shelby would be my teacher, I was excited to learn she would be the one teaching.

Lucky us and lucky students! She&#39;s a joy to work with.</p>&mdash; Mason Stewart (@masondesu) <a href="https://twitter.com/masondesu/statuses/455122730921508864">April 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

Why? She's a self-taught Rubyist that has only been coding for a handful of years. She doesn't have a C.S. degree and made the move to learn to program after college and having a career. So, she can relate to everyone in our cohort. Because of this, she draws from her own experiences and knows how much we are capable of, pushing us accordingly. In addition, she taught English as a second-language to children in Nepal which is so important because programming is also a language. 

## Teammates 
Your "teammates" are others that have set out to accomplish the same exact thing as you. My teammates are those who are a part of the spring [Rails cohort](http://theironyard.com/academy/rails-engineering/) at The Iron Yard. We are in it together, day in and day out. We learn together, work together, and laugh together (which is essential, *trust me*). We all live on HipChat, where we can send out a call for help or post some memes for comic relief. There are times when you can lift up a fellow teammate teammates and others are accessible to help you understand what they too struggled with. 

No matter what you set out to accomplish, there is always value in building a team that, in turn, can help build you up. Setting out to achieve something great? Build a great team.
