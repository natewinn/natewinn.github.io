    puts Hello World

Hi, my name is [Nathan Winn](http://natewinn.com/colophon/). You can call me Nate. This is my new home. Welcome.

I've wanted to start a blog for a *very* long time. I've owned this domain for years, but I've made excuse after excuse to not get something started. You know, the typical ones. "I don't have enough time," "nobody is interested in what I have to say," and "I'm not talented enough to make the site look good." 

Recently, I've been challenged by both [John Saddington]({% post_url 2014-04-08-how-to-win-the-internet %}) and my good friend, [Jad Limcaco](http://jadlimcaco.com/blog/homeless-designers/) to create an online presence. So, this past Friday, I determined I would get a blog up and running by **today**.

Though this is *technically* my first post, I'm sure you'll notice there's quite a bit of content already posted. I started writing posts in my text editor since I began my coding journey at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) knowing that one day, I would finally create a site to post them. *That day is today*!

This blog is rolling on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Here's why I chose Jekyll...

##Fast Setup
No, really. It is super fast to get up and running. If you don't believe me, check out this [tutorial](https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47). You can have it up and running in about 10 minutes without an tweaks configurations.

##Built on Ruby
Jekyll is not really a CMS, but a parsing engine bundled as a Ruby gem. It is a static site that is created by dynamic components. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator." It is focused on blogging, but it has been used to create some pretty [epic sites](http://kylerush.net/blog/meet-the-obama-campaigns-250-million-fundraising-platform/) too. Since I'm currently learning Rails having a "blog" built in Ruby is a perfect fit.

##Hosted on GitHub Pages 
After pushing your Jekyll site to GitHub, you can make it viewable on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Again, super easy and **free**! You heard right, free. Refer back to the previous [tutorial](https://medium.com/web-design-and-development/4d3e24320d47) to see just how easy setup is. You can *even* redirect your site on GitHub Pages to your own URL simply by updating your DNS A Record and creating a CNAME file in the root directory that includes the name of the URL you're pointing to. Did I mention it's free?

##Text Editor + GitHub = Winning
Jekyll allow me to write content just like I'm coding. I'm taking an immersive approach in learning to code so, "blogging" with Jekyll will become another way I can practice coding and GitHub. It really is a winn-winn. See what I did there?

I would love to hear what you think! Give me a shout out in the comments or reach out to me on Twitter at [@natewinn](https://twitter.com/natewinn).
