In 2007, Atul Gawande, general surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and associate professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, wrote an article for the New Yorker entitled [The Checklist](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all). This article later developed into a New York Times Bestseller, [The Checklist Manifesto](http://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-Things-Right/dp/0312430000). The bookâ€™s main point is simple: no matter how expert you may be, well-designed checklists can improve outcomes. In fact, [Jack Dorsey](https://twitter.com/jack), co-founder of Twitter and founder of Square, gives a copy of this [book](http://www.sfgate.com/technology/businessinsider/article/Jack-Dorsey-Gives-Everyone-He-Hires-The-Same-Red-3909392.php) to everyone hired at Square.

I read the book several years ago but was reminded of it as we dug into Sinatra this week. [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) is a Ruby framework similar to RubyOnRails, but more lightweight. To be quite honest, I did *horribly* on the assignment the first day we covered into Sinatra. I struggled to keep up in class which made the assignment tremendously difficult to complete. In fact, I didn't finish it. Our assignment was to create a web app that met the following requirements . . .

1. List of favorite things
2. Be able to match input against certain criteria 
3. Create at 3 pages (error page, index page, and form)

##Checklist . . . Check
Day two of Sinatra, I created a checklist. A simple list that outlined every step I needed to take to get a basic Sinatra [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) app up and running. The checklist helped me immensely! With as fast as we are moving, I realized there is no possible way I'm going to remember every step. If a world-class surgeon can rely on a checklist to ensure his procedure goes according to plan, I'm pretty sure a newbie coder could use one too. 

If you're learning a new skill or technique, I would encourage you to create a checklist to act as a guide. Practice doesn't make perfect; practice makes permanent. Don't view a checklist as a crutch, especially when you're first starting out. View it as a tool to ensure you are learning a new skill correctly.
