That's right. Mistakes are a **good** thing. They're mandatory for learning. You have to mess up to learn a new skill. I don't care who you are, *failure will be inevitable* when doing something for the first time.

## Even the Elite Fail
I love watching the Olympics. It's fascinating when the TV network highlights an athlete to show a behind-the-scenes look into the incredible effort it took to compete among the world's elite. Often, you will see images of a 3-year-old falling down on skis for the first time or a skater practicing the same jump over and over and over again because it's not quite right. In other words, Olympic athletes shine on the world stage because they have failed time and time again.

## Fail, Learn, Repeat
During [Big Data Week](http://bigdataweek.com/atlanta/) a few weeks back, I attended a panel hosted at AKQA. The topic was [How to Become a Developer or Data Scientist](http://www.meetup.com/Atlantas-Big-Data-Week-2014/events/176519662/?gj=rcs.j&a=co2.j_grp&rv=rcs.j). Though the developers sitting on the panel had vastly different backgrounds, experience levels, and skill-sets, they had one common consensus . . . *write code*. Even if it's horrible, just start writing. And then write more code; throw it out; write some more, and then write even more.

The way you're going to become a developer is by being one. Don't be afraid to mess up! I can't tell you how many times I've laughed at the code I wrote when I first showed up to The Iron Yard. Frankly, it's horrible. But, that horrible code *taught me so much*. Forget copying and pasting. Start typing, mess stuff up, and figure out how to fix it. Failure will always be your best teacher.
