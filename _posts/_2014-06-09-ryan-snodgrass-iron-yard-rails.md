Ryan Snodgrass is the *third* interview from the members of [The Iron Yard - Atlanta Rails](http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/) cohort.

## What were you up to before coming to The Iron Yard?
I went to the University of Central Florida and got a degree in cinema studies. Completely unrelated to programming. In fact, I took a Java or JavaScript class while I was there. I think it was Java. . . I really don't remember. But, I do remember I *bombed* it. I failed the class within the first month. Nothing really materialized with my degree so, I found myself working at a call center in Orlando, Florida. It was like the worst job in the world.

I have told this story so many times now, but the position was contract to hire. If I worked hard enough, they would hire me as a full-time employee. But, I knew by taking the position, it was going to be a couple of months before I would be offered a position. A couple of months passed, and I still didn't get hired. The thing about a call center is you have just what you need to do your job. You are trained to know *exactly* how to find specific answers. So, after working for a while, you master the tools and get comfortable with what's going on. And then they say, "Surprise, this department doesn't need you anymore, but we like you enough that we are going to move you to another department." After the third time this happened to me, I became *very frustrated with what I was doing*. 

I've always been technically savvy, building my own computers and running Linux, nothing major, but definitely more technical stuff than the average Joe would attempt. I tried to get into the tech department at the call center. I had a friend who was one of the recruiters for that department and even recommended that I interview for a position. I went in for an interview, and they liked me. But, they eventually hired someone with more experience. So, about a year ago, I knew I would have to *do something different* to get a position I desired. I began learning programming on my own with [Tree House](http://teamtreehouse.com/), and things like that, but it seemed like it was just taking forever. 

## Why did you choose The Iron Yard?
Mom and dad live up here in Atlanta. They actually just recently moved here. I was living in Orlando, and my parents didn't like that too much. Mom wanted me to move to Atlanta and in time raise a family here. You know she's hoping for grandkids one day. Dad found an article from the Business Journal that highlighted [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/locations/atlanta/). He knew I was learning to code on my own and encouraged me to look into it. I started looking into other thing that were written about The Iron Yard, and all I could find were stellar reviews. I couldn't believe the guaranteed job placement. The [website](http://theironyard.com/) looked amazing so, I took a shot and applied to it. The next thing I know, [John Saddington](https://twitter.com/saddington) called me up. I really didn't look into any other bootcamps or programs. Mom and dad said, "Listen, if you come up to Atlanta, you can live with us for free, and we will pay for your class." How could I turn that down? I mean don't get me wrong, I researched The Iron Yard heavily, but I never considered another program. Everything that I saw or read about The Iron Yard was very positive. I felt that I didn't have to look any further than The Iron Yard. 

## Why Ruby on Rails?
As I mentioned, I was a cinema major in college and had a strong visual background. I also knew from college that there were people far more creative than I was and far more talented at design than I could ever be. So, in light of that *I felt back-end development would be a better fit for me*. When I was in high school, I had never drawn before. I was really bad at drawing, but somehow I developed an ability for still life drawing. Surprisingly, I became one of the best artists in my high school. One of my drawings actually won second place in a state wide art festival. Really cool, right? So, I think to myself, "Yeah, I am a real rockstar. I'm the best in my high school, I'm best in the state." Then, I get to college and realize just how talented the other artists are around me were. I knew that I could never compete with them. I understand it's not a competition, but I definitely wasn't as good as I thought I was. I took that into consideration when choosing Rails, and I believe I made the right choice. I really enjoy the problem solving. *It's like I'm solving puzzles all day*. 

## Expectations vs. actual experience?
I knew The Iron Yard was going to be exceptionally hard. I will say that my classmates are a lot *less* nerdy than I thought they would be. On a side note, I'm really surprised at how many married people there are in the class. That was definitely surprising. I just assumed everyone would be young and single. For the most part though, everyone is kind of the same, mid 20s to early 30s, intelligent. Everyone here is really intelligent; it's very obvious. And everyone is really nice. There are very broad backgrounds. We've got Jeff who is an engineer. I studied cinema. Sid a chemical engineer. Chris worked in non-profits. Dave worked for the DoD. Dan did marketing. *Such a broad range of backgrounds which has definitely made things interesting*.

## Best advice for those considering a coding bootcamp?
Prepare as much as you possibly can! I found out about The Iron Yard a month before it began so, I didn't have much time to prepare. Though, I did do quite a bit on [Tree House](http://teamtreehouse.com/) prior to my arrival. I completed the Ruby track on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) before attending with John's recommendation. I hear [Michael Hartl's tutorials](http://www.railstutorial.org/book) are really good. Definitely get familiar with the [Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/) and [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) docs. We use them a lot! Ruby docs will be used day 1.

Be prepared to work very long and very hard. Realize that you're not going to have a life for three month. It seems like that I'm working non-stop but, I make it a point to not code on Sunday. *It's a chance to hit the reset button*. But, it is honestly hard to not think about code. Last Sunday, I went to the Atlanta History Museum with my family, and I found myself thinking about code. Specifically, Ajax. I was wondering how I could get past a specific problem I was struggling with. But, I do my best to try put those thoughts in the back of my mind and rest my mind for at least one day a week. 

## What do you enjoy most about The Iron Yard?
Free beer. Wait . . . is this thing recording? In all honesty, the tools The Iron Yard provides for usâ€”24-hour access to [ATV](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), the guest speakers, John Saddington, the meet-ups, and opportunities like [start-up weekend](http://atlanta.startupweekend.org/) and [hack-a-thons](https://twitter.com/timwco/status/475279395738124288/photo/1). The Atlanta Tech Village, where we have our classes, is absolutely amazing. It's a fantastic building with some incredible amenities. But, by far, the student body is the best! Everyone here is so much fun to be around and just hang out. We often *waste* time just sitting around chatting and I enjoy every minute of it. We're all in this thing together, there's no room for egos. We all pick each other up and that creates a really positive environment.

## Your experience before coming to The Iron Yard?
Failing Java, haha. 

## Where do you see yourself going from here?
I've been so focused lately, that I haven't even thought about it. *And believe me, that's a good thing*. The last thing you need is something to distract you from coding. I haven't even thought of the big picture once I'm done. I'd love to get a job overseas in some place exotic. Working as a developer in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Venice, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tokyo, Okinawa, or Osaka would be awesome. I really like the idea that as a developer, I can work remotely from anywhere.
