Day one of The Iron Yard has come to an end. After some preliminary announcements and a quick tour of the [Atlanta Tech Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/), we hit the ground running. Actually, it was more like *sprinting*.

##Rolling with Ruby 
We quickly got our MacBooks on the same page using [InstallRails.com](http://installrails.com/). I found this site when I completed [One Month Rails](http://onemonthrails.com/signup?discount_code=EGkdkT). Install Rails will quickly guide you through the process of installing all the tools you need to get RubyonRails up and running on a Mac, PC, or Linux install. I would *highly recommend* it if you're not quite sure what you need to get Rails up and running. We spent the remaining class time covering arrays and I was pretty much lost...

##Guess Who?
Our first assignment was to create a guessing game in Ruby that runs in the terminal with the following requirements:

1. Array of options
2. Randomly select option for user to guess
3. Give hints to user
4. Do not define your own methods or classes

##Finally!
It's just after 12:00am, and I *just* got my app to work! Check out the [gist](https://gist.github.com/natewinn/9912926) on GitHub. To be completely honest, I'm not entirely sure how in the world I got this to work.
