I came across this tweet today from the Wall Street Journal...

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>In 2009, BlackBerry accounted for about half of the North American smartphone market. Now it is 0.6%. <a href="http://t.co/4q1SS7IcSt">http://t.co/4q1SS7IcSt</a></p>&mdash; Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ/statuses/468230010986561536">May 19, 2014</a></blockquote>

Despite Blackberry's dominance in mobile phones, Apple chose to launch the iPhone late in the game. They igonored the doubters and set out to prove everyone wrong. What are you refusing to do because the odds are stacked against you? Ignore the doubters and start *today*. Who knowsâ€”you just *might* prove the critics [wrong](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aRelVKWbMAv0).
