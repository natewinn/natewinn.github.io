Having someone with which to strive toward a common goal will exponentially increase your chances of success. This is exactly why the [cohort model](http://john.do/dream-big-dreams/) at The Iron Yard is so awesome. When sailing out into unchartered territory and attempting to achieve something big, it is *vital* to have someone you can be accountable to—someone who is able to celebrate each success, yet encourage with every setback. 

## An Equal Challenge
When my wife and I finally decided I would attend The Iron Yard, she also wanted to challenge herself. She knew I was facing the most difficult challenges of my life so; she also wanted conquer something equally as challenging—run a marathon. As we have both had our ups and downs in striving to reach our goals, we are able to *keep each other motivated* to stay on track to reach our respective goals.

## Motivated By Others
This weekend, I was able to fly across the country for just a day and a half to see my wife complete the [Western Pacific Marathon](http://www.brazenracing.com/westernpacific.html). It was incredibly motivating to see her cross that finish line. I keep a picture of her wearing the finisher's medal on my desktop and often look at it during the day. It motivates me to press forward becuase I so often get discouraged.

There have been *numerous* times along the way that I've really wanted to throw in the towel. It says **intensive** on The Iron Yard website for good reason! But, I try to remember the [people]({% post_url 2014-04-15-teamwork-makes-the-dream-work %}) pulling for me, and I don't want to let them down. I would encourage you in setting out to achieve something big, take someone along for the ride.
