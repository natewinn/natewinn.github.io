My name is Nate Winn and I live in the heart of the Silicon Valley with my wife Jo and my little boy, Owen. Currently, I'm attending fulfilling a dream and attending the RubyOnRails cohort at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) in Atlanta.

You'll find me writing about a myriad of topics on this site, but predominately coding, technology, and design will be the topics. I've been writing here since 2014.

You can also find me on Twitter, [here](https://twitter.com/natewinn) or on GitHub, [here](https://github.com/poole).

## My Setup

This blog is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), run by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), built on the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme, and written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I'm a big fan of apple products. I write and code on a 2011 [13-inch MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) and talk and text on an [iPhone 5](https://www.apple.com/iphone/).

## Mac Tools

My toolbox is pretty basic though I am constantly trying out new software to see if it improves my workflow. You can take a closer look at the software I use on a daily basis below.	

* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to remember
* [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/) to email
* [Aodobe CC](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) to design
* [Dropbox](https://db.tt/l0Vpv4R) to store and share
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_US/chrome/browser/) to browse
* [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) to jot notes
* [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to plan
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to code
* [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) to save time
* [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) to tweet

## Other Tools

I also couldn't do without [The Roost Stand](http://www.therooststand.com/) to perch my laptop up, [Parrot Zik Headphones](http://www.parrot.com/zik/usa/) to block out distractions, [Apple Wireless Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/keyboard/), and [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/magicmouse/). I'm always scribbling jotting down thoughts. Currently, these are captured in a [Barron Fig Confidant](http://www.baronfig.com/). I tote all this stuff around in a [Minaal backpack](http://www.minaal.com/).
