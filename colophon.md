My name is Nate Winn, and I live in the heart of the Silicon Valley with my wife [Jo](http://twitter.com/jo_winn) and my little boy, Owen. Currently, I'm a part of the [RubyOnRails](http://rubyonrails.org/) cohort at [The Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/) based out of [Atlanta Tech Village](http://atlantatechvillage.com/).

You'll find me writing about a myriad of topics here, but mostly coding, technology, and design. This has been my virtual home since 2014.

You can also find me tweeting, [here](https://twitter.com/natewinn) and committing, [here](https://github.com/natewinn).

## My Setup
This blog is run on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), built on the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme, written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and proofed by my amazing wife (you should hire [her](http://www.fiverr.com/jowinn/proofread-and-edit-your-document)).

I'm a fan of Apple products. I write and code on a 2011 [13-inch MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/) and talk and text on an [iPhone 5](https://www.apple.com/iphone/). I also snap pictures on a [Canon70D](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-20-2-Digital-Camera-Pixel/dp/B00DMS0GTC). 

## My Toolbox
My software toolbox is pretty basic though I'm constantly trying out new tools to see if my workflow improves. I've found that I don't need a bunch of fancy tools to get the job done, just a few really good ones. Here's a list of what I use on the daily.	

* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to remember
* [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com/) to email
* [Aodobe CC](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) to design
* [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/?l=en) to upload
* [Dropbox](https://db.tt/l0Vpv4R) to store and share
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_US/chrome/browser/) to browse
* [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) to jot notes
* [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) to plan
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to code
* [TextExpander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html) to save time
* [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) to tweet
* [YNAB](http://ynab.referralcandy.com/5KWFLW8) to budget

## Other Essentials
In addition, I couldn't do without [The Roost Stand](http://www.therooststand.com/) to perch my laptop, [Parrot Zik Headphones](http://www.parrot.com/zik/usa/) to block out distractions, and the [Apple Wireless Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/keyboard/) and [Apple Magic Mouse](https://www.apple.com/magicmouse/) combo. I'm always scribbling down my thoughts in various notebooks. Currently, these are captured in a [Barron Fig Confidant](http://www.baronfig.com/). And last, but not least, I tote everything around in a [Minaal backpack](http://www.minaal.com/).
